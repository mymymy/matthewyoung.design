		<h3>Friday, May 17th</h3>

		<p>
			At last it happened. I was sitting in the café, next to the window. This time I wasn’t waiting for anything or watching out for anyone. I think I was adding numbers in the vain attempt to balance the expenses with the income of this slow month of May, truly autumnal and overflowing with debts. I lifted my head and there she was, like an apparition or a ghost or simply – and so much the better – like Avellaneda. “I’m here for that cup of coffee you offered me the other day,” she said. I stood up, bumping into the chair, and the little coffee spoon slid off the table, causing a racket more akin to a ladle. The waiters stared; she sat down. I picked up the spoon, but before I could sit down my jacket got caught on that damned rim that’s on the back of all the chairs. In my dress rehearsal for this desired encounter, I hadn’t counted on such an agitated staging. “It looks like I scared you,” she said, laughing candidly. “Well, yes, a little bit,” I confessed, and that saved me. The casualness had been recovered. We talked about the office, some fellow workers, and I related some anecdotes about the old times. She laughed. She was wearing a little dark green jacket over a white blouse. Her hair was uncombed, but only the right side, as if a gale wind had blown against her only on that side. I told her about it and she took a little mirror out of her bag, looked at herself, and for a while enjoyed looking at how ridiculous she looked. I liked that her good sense of humor was such that she could make fun of herself. Then I said: “Do you know that you are responsible for one of the most important crisis in my life?” And still laughing, she asked: “Economic?” I replied: “No, emotional,” and she became serious. “Oh God!,” she said, and waited for me to continue. And I did: “Look, Avellaneda, it’s possible that what I’m about to say sounds crazy. If it is, just say so. But I don’t want to beat around the bush: I think I’m in love with you.” I waited a few moments, but she didn’t say a word and just stared at her purse. I think she blushed a little, but I didn’t try to ascertain if she blushed from embarrassment or was just radiant. Then I continued: “In light of our respective ages, the most logical thing would have been to keep my mouth shut, but in any case, I think it was a tribute that I owed you. I’m not going to demand anything. If you, now or tomorrow or whenever, tell me to stop, we won’t discuss the matter anymore and we’ll remain friends. And don’t be afraid about your job or your peace of mind at the office; I know how to behave, don’t worry.” Again I waited. There she was, defenseless, that is to say, being defended by me from myself. Whatever she might say, whatever attitude she might have, it was going to signify: “This is the color of your future.” Finally, I couldn’t wait any longer and said: “And?” I forced a smile and added, with a trembling voice that refuted the joke I was trying to make: “Do you have anything to declare?” She stopped staring at her purse. When she raised her eyes I had a feeling the worst had passed. “I already knew,” she said. “That’s why I came to have coffee.”
