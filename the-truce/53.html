			Aníbal called. We’re going to meet tomorrow.

			Avellaneda didn’t come to work today. Jaime asked me for money. He had never asked for money before so I asked him what he needed it for. “I can’t, nor want, to tell you. Lend me the money if you want, otherwise keep it. It’s all the same to me,” Jaime said. “All the same?” I said. “Yes, it’s all the same,” Jaime said. “Because if I have to pay the intrusive price of opening up my personal life, my heart, and spilling my guts, etc., I’d rather find the money elsewhere, where I will only be charged interest.” I gave him the money, of course. But, why so violent? A mere question isn’t an intrusive price. Worst of all, what angers me the most, is that I usually ask those questions completely absentmindedly, because the last thing I want to do is meddle in the private lives of others, and much less, in the lives of my children. But Jaime, as much as Esteban, is always in a state of near-conflict where I’m concerned. They’re not children anymore; so let them fend for themselves anyway they can.
