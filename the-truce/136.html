		<h3>Monday, September 2nd</h3>

		<p>
			I was welcomed back like a savior; that is to say, with all the issues they hadn’t been able to resolve. It looks like they had a visit from an inspector and he created a furor about something stupid. Muñoz, the poor man, drowns in a glass of water. I found Santini to be more effeminate than usual as he made several lewd and silly faces at me. Could these also be platonic? They say that because I turned down their promotion, they’re going to bring in an assistant manager from another company. Martínez is raging mad. Today, for the first time since the Suárez uproar, the Valverde woman made an appearance. She moves her rear end with an enthusiasm worthy of a better cause.
