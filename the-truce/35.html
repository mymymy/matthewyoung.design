		<h3>Sunday, April 7th</h3>

		<p>
			Almost every Sunday, I eat lunch and dinner alone and inevitably become melancholic. “What have I done with my life?” is a question that is reminiscent of Gardel, the Woman’s Supplement of the La Mañana newspaper, or an article from Reader’s Digest. But it doesn’t matter. Today, Sunday, I feel as if I’m beyond the ridiculous and can ask myself these kinds of questions. In my particular case, there have been no irrational changes or unusual and sudden turns. Isabel’s death was most extraordinary. Does the real key to what I consider to be my frustration lie in Isabel’s death? I don’t think so. Furthermore, the more I inquire, the more I’m convinced that her untimely death was a case of misfortune with, let’s say, luck. (Good God, how mean and coarse this sounds. I’m horrifying myself). I mean to say that when Isabel died I was 28 years old and she was 25. We were, then, at the very peak of desire. I think she was the inspiration for my most impassioned physical desire. Perhaps that’s why although I’m incapable of reconstructing (with my own images, not with photographs or memories of memories) Isabel’s face, I can, instead, once again feel in my hands, every time I need to, the particular contour of her waist, her stomach, her calves, her breasts. Why do the palms of my hands have a more faithful memory than I do? One conclusion that I can draw from all of this is that if Isabel had lived long enough for her body to sag (that was one good thing about her: smooth and taut skin) and therefore weigh down my capacity to desire her, I can’t guarantee what would have happened to our exemplary bond. Because all of our real harmony inexorably depended on what happened in the bedroom, our bedroom. I don’t mean to say that during the day we got along like cat and dog; on the contrary, in our daily life we used a good dose of amity. But what could impede the outbursts, the overflows? Simply, the enjoyment of our evenings, its protective presence in the midst of the displeasures of the day. If at any time we were tempted by hatred and started to become angry, the lure of past and future evenings would flash before our eyes, and then, inevitably, a wave of tenderness enveloped us, placating every outburst of anger. I’m not unhappy about this. My marriage was a good thing, and a happy time in my life.

			But, what about the rest? There is the opinion that one can have about oneself, which incredibly, has very little to do with vanity. I refer to the opinion that is completely sincere, the opinion that one wouldn’t dare to confess even to the mirror in front of which one shaves. I remember a time (between the ages of 16 and 20) during which I had a good, and I’d almost say, excellent opinion of myself. I felt the urge to accomplish “something great,” to be useful to many, to rectify things. It can’t be said I had a cretinous, egocentric attitude. Even though I would have liked to have received the praise and acceptance of others, I think my prime objective wasn’t to make use of the others, but to be useful to them. I know this isn’t pure and Christian charity; but then again, I don’t care too much about the Christian sense of charity. I remember I didn’t pretend to help the needy, or the disabled, or the wretched (I have less and less faith in chaotically distributed aid). My intention was more modest; simply, to be of use to my peers who had a more understandable right to need from me.

			In truth, that excellent opinion of me has decayed quite a bit. Today I feel common, and in some respects, defenseless. I could tolerate my lifestyle better if I weren’t aware (only mentally, of course) that I’m above that commonness. To know that I have, or had, within me, the tools sufficient to scale another possibility, to know that I’m superior somewhat, at my outdated job, my few hobbies, my rhythm of speech; knowing all of this, of course, doesn’t help my tranquility, but rather makes me feel more frustrated, more incapable of overcoming circumstances. Worst of all is that no terrible things occurred to besiege me (well, Isabel’s death is hard, but I can’t call it terrible; after all, is there anything more natural than leaving this world?), halt my best impulses, impede my development, or tie me to a lethargic routine. I have devised my own routine, but in the simplest way:  accumulation. The security of knowing that I’m capable of something better has allowed me to procrastinate, which when all is said and done, is a terrible and suicidal weapon. Hence, my routine never had character or definition; it has always been temporary, always represented a precarious route, to be followed only as long as my procrastination lasted, and only to endure the onus of the workday during that period of preparation I apparently considered indispensable before finally launching into my destiny. What nonsense, huh? Now it so happens I don’t have important vices (I smoke little, and only out of boredom drink a shot of rum from time to time), but I think that I couldn’t stop procrastinating: this is my vice, which is, moreover, incurable. Because if at this moment I was to decide to reassure myself, in a kind of belated oath: “I’m going to be exactly what I wanted to be,” everything would end up being pointless. First, because I feel I have limited strength,  to gamble it on a change of life, and also because, how valid is what I wanted to be backing then, to me now? It would almost be like consciously rushing into a premature senility. What I desire now is much more modest than what I desired thirty years ago and, above all, it matters much less if I get it. To retire, for example. Naturally, it’s an aspiration, but it’s a downhill aspiration. I know that it’s going to arrive, that it’s going to arrive alone, and it won’t be necessary for me to do anything. It’s easy this way, it makes surrendering and making decisions worthwhile.
