		<h3>Wednesday, January 22nd</h3>

		<p>
			Sometimes I talk to Blanca about her. I don’t cry or despair; I simply talk. I know there’s an echo there. It’s Blanca who cries, despairs. She says she can’t believe in God, that God has been giving and then taking away opportunities from me, nor does she feel strong enough to believe in a cruel God, an absolute sadist. Nevertheless, I don’t feel so spiteful. On September 23rd, I not only wrote “My God,” a number of times, I also said it, felt it. For the first time in my life, I though I could talk to Him. But God’s part in our conversation was weak, vacillating, as if He wasn’t too sure of Himself. Perhaps I had almost moved Him. I also had the feeling that a decisive argument existed, an argument that was right next to me, in front of me, and that despite this, I still couldn’t recognize it or add it to my plea. Then, after that time limit He had granted me to convince Him had elapsed, after that hint of vacillation and timidity had come to an end, God finally regained His powers. God went back to being the almighty Negation He had always been. Still, I can’t feel rancor towards Him, I can’t paw at Him with my hatred. I know he gave me the opportunity and I didn’t know how to take advantage of it. Perhaps someday I’ll be able to understand that unique and decisive argument, but by then I’ll already be terribly withered, and just now withered even more so. Sometimes I think that if God played fair, He also would have given me the argument I should use against Him. But no, it can’t be. I don’t want a God to support me, who doesn’t choose to trust me with the key with which to return, sooner or later, to my conscience; I don’t want a God who offers me everything ready-made, like one of those prosperous fathers from the Rambla , filthy rich, was able to do with his snobby, useless little son. No, definitely not that. Now my relationship with God has grown cold. He knows I’m not capable of convincing him. I know that He’s a distant solitude, to which I never had, nor will ever have, access. So that’s how we are now, each of us on our own shore, without hating or loving each other, strangers.
