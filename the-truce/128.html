		<h3>Sunday, August 25th</h3>

			She brought me pictures of her childhood, of her family, of her world. It’s proof of love, right? She was a skinny child, with somewhat frightened eyes, and long, dark hair. An only child. I too was an only child. And it’s not easy. One ends up feeling helpless. There is a delightful photograph in which she appears with an enormous police dog, and the dog is looking at her with an air of protection. I guess that everyone always must have wanted to protect her at one time or another. She isn’t so defenseless, however, she is quite sure of what she wants. And besides, I like that she’s sure. She’s sure that her job suffocates her, that she’ll never commit suicide, that Marxism is a serious mistake, that she likes me, that death isn’t the end of everything, that her parents are splendid, that God exists, and that the people she trusts will never let her down. I could never be that categorical. But the best thing is that she’s not wrong. Her certainty even helps her to intimidate fate. There is a photograph of her and her parents, when she was twelve years old. Based on that photograph, I also dare to construct my impression of that singular, harmonious, and different marriage. Her mother has soft features, delicate nose, black hair, and very light skin, with two moles on her left cheek. Her eyes are serene, possibly too much so; perhaps they’re of no use to completely commit to the spectacle they’re witnessing, in what they see existing, but they seem capable of understanding everything. Her father is a tall man, with rather narrow shoulders, a baldness which had already begun its damage, very thin lips, and a very sharp, but not aggressive chin. I worry quite a bit about people’s eyes. His are a little unbalanced. But certainly not because they’re alienated, but because they’re strange. They are the eyes of a man who is surprised by the world, by the mere act of finding himself in it. They’re both (you can see it in their faces) good people, but I like her kindness better than his. The father is an excellent man, but he isn’t capable of communicating with the world, so that one can’t possibly know what would happen on the day he finally manages to establish that communication. “They love each other, I’m sure about that,” says Avellaneda, “but I don’t know if that’s the kind of love that I like.” She shakes her head to accompany her doubt, and then is inspired to add: “There are a series of neighboring and kindred areas regarding feelings which are easy to confuse. Love, trust, pity, camaraderie, tenderness; I never know in which one of these areas my parents’ relationship exists. It’s something which is very hard to define and I don’t think they themselves have defined it. On occasion, mom and I have briefly discussed the topic. She believes there is too much serenity in her union with my father; too much balance for love to really exist. That serenity, that balance, which could also be called lack of passion, perhaps might have been unbearable if they would have had something to blame each other for. But there is nothing to blame each other for, nor any reasons for reproach. They know themselves to be good, honest, generous. They also know that all of that, even as magnificent as it is, still doesn’t signify love, nor does it signify that they burn in that fire. They don’t burn, and that which unites them lasts even longer.” “And what about you and me? Are we burning?” I asked. But at that precise moment she was distracted, and the look in her eyes was also like that of someone surprised by the world, by the mere fact of finding herself in it.
