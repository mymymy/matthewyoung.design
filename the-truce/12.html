		<h3>Friday, March 1st</h3>

		<p>
			The manager held a meeting with the five section directors. For forty-five minutes he talked to us about low staff production. He said that the Board of Directors made him realize this situation, and that in the future, he wasn’t going to allow his position to be gratuitously affected because of their laziness (how he likes to emphasize “laziness”). So that from now on, etc., etc.
		</p>

			What do they mean by “low staff production?” At least I can say that my people work. And not only the new workers, but the veterans too. It’s true that Méndez reads detective novels which he clearly places in the middle drawer of his desk, all the while holding a pen in his right hand in preparation for the possible appearance of some manager. It’s true that Muñoz takes advantage of his trips to the Excess Profits Department by stealing twenty minutes of leisure from the company, nursing a beer. It’s true that when Robledo goes to the bathroom (at ten-fifteen, exactly) he carries either the color newspaper supplement or the sports section hidden under his smock. But it’s also true that the work is always up to date, and that in the hours during which the transaction needs urgent attention and the drawer crammed with invoices circulates continuously, they all exert themselves and really work as a team. Each of them is an expert in their limited specialty and I can have complete confidence that things are being done correctly.

			Actually, I know quite well where the manager’s complaint was directed. “Shipping” works lazily and moreover, does its job badly. Today we all knew that his complaint was about Suárez, so why ask all of us to attend the meeting? What right does Suárez have to share his exclusive blame with all of us? Could it be because the manager knows, like all of us, that Suárez sleeps with the president’s daughter? That Lidia Valverde isn’t bad looking.
