		<h3>Saturday, July 6th</h3>

		<p>
			It rained buckets during the afternoon. For twenty minutes we waited on a corner for the rain to subside and looked discouragingly at the people running by. But we were inevitably getting cold and I started to sneeze with menacing regularity. Finding a taxi was virtually impossible. Since we were only two blocks from the apartment we decided to walk. Actually, we, too, ran like crazy and reached the apartment in three soaked minutes. For a while I remained very fatigued and lay useless on the bed. Before that, however, I had the strength to find a blanket and wrap it around her. She had taken off her dripping jacket and her skirt which was in a pitiful condition. Little by little, I regained my composure and half an hour later began to feel warm. I went to the kitchen, lit the kerosene stove, and started to boil water. She called me from the bedroom. She had gotten out of bed, just like that, wrapped in the blanket, and was standing near the window watching the rain. I approached, also looking at the rain, and we didn’t say anything for a while. All of a sudden, I realized that that moment, that slice of everyday life, was the highest degree of well-being, it was Happiness. Never before had I been so completely happy than at that moment, but still I had the cutting sensation I would never feel that way again, at least at that level, with that intensity. The pinnacle of happiness is like that, surely it’s like that. Furthermore, I’m sure the pinnacle is only a second long, a brief second, a flashing instant, and there’s no right to an extension. Down below, a dog wearing a muzzle was slowly trotting along, hopelessly resigned. All of a sudden, the dog stopped, and obeying a strange inspiration, raised one of its legs and then very peacefully continued his trot. Actually, it looked like the dog had stopped to make sure it was still raining. We looked at each other simultaneously and started to laugh. I assumed the spell had been broken, that the arrival at the famous pinnacle had passed. But she was still with me; I could hear her, feel her, kiss her. I could simply say: “Avellaneda.” “Avellaneda” is, furthermore, a world of words. I’m learning how to inject her with hundreds of meanings and she’s learning to remember them. It’s a game. In the morning, I say: “Avellaneda,” and it means: “Good morning.” (There is an “Avellaneda” that is reproach, another that is a warning, and yet another that is an apology.) But she purposely misunderstands me to make me fume. When I say the “Avellaneda” which means: “Let’s make love,” she, very cheerfully replies: “You think I should leave now? But it’s so early!” Oh, the old days when Avellaneda was just a surname, the surname of the new assistant (just five months ago I wrote: “The girl doesn’t seem too interested in work, but at least she understands what is explained to her”), the label with which to identify that small person with the wide forehead and the large mouth who looked at me with enormous respect. And there she was now, in front of me, wrapped in her blanket. I don’t remember what she was like when she seemed insignificant to me, inhibited, nothing more than pleasant. I only remember what she’s like now: a delicious young woman who captivates me, makes my heart absurdly excited, and conquers me. I blinked intentionally, so that nothing would impede us afterwards. Then she was wrapped in my gaze, which was much better than her blanket; actually, it wasn’t independent of my voice, which had already started to say: “Avellaneda.” And this time she understood me perfectly.
