		<h3>Monday, July 15th</h3>

			When all is said and done, Aníbal could be right; I’m avoiding marriage more because I’m afraid of ridicule than because I’m defending Avellaneda’s future. And that wouldn’t be right because there’s one thing that’s true, and that is that I love her. I write this for my eyes only, so it doesn’t matter if it sounds pretentious. It’s the truth. Period. Therefore, I don’t want her to suffer. I thought (actually, I thought I knew) that I was eluding a permanent situation so that Avellaneda would always be free, so that in a few years she wouldn’t feel chained to an old man. If now it turns out that was just an excuse I made up, while the real reason was a kind of insurance against future deceptions, it’s quite clear  the entire framework and outward appearance of our relationship had to be changed. Perhaps she would suffer more from a clandestine situation, always temporary, than being tied down to a man twice her age. After all, by fearing ridicule I misjudge her, and that’s terrible of me. I know she’s a good person, that she is made of good stock. I know that if she were ever to fall in love with someone else, she wouldn’t leave me in that humiliating ignorance which constitutes the affront to those who are deceived. Maybe she would tell me, or somehow I would manage to grasp the situation and have enough composure to understand it. But perhaps it would be better to talk to her about it, grant her the power to decide for herself, and help her feel secure.
