		<h3>Friday, May 24th</h3>

		<p>
			It’s a kind of game now at the office. The game of the Boss and the Assistant. The rules are: don’t fall out of rhythm, behave differently, or change the routine. At nine o’clock in the morning I distribute the work to Muñoz, Robledo, Avellaneda, and Santini. Avellaneda is one name on the list, just another one of those who extend their hand in front of my desk so I can hand them the payroll accounts. There’s Muñoz’s hand: large, wrinkled, with claw-like nails; Robledo’s hand: small, almost square; Santini’s hand: thin fingers, two rings; and nearby, Avellaneda’s hand, with fingers that look like Santini’s, only feminine instead of effeminate. I’ve already told her that every time she approaches my desk with the others and extends her hand, I place (mentally, of course) a gentlemanly kiss on her sharp, sensible knuckles. She says it’s not obvious from the look on my stone face. Sometimes she’s tempted, and tries to infect me with an irrepressible desire to laugh, but I remain firm. So firm, that this afternoon Muñoz approached me and asked if something was wrong; he noticed I had been looking a little preoccupied over the last few days. “Are you worried about the upcoming balance sheet?” he asked. “Relax, boss. We’ll update the books quickly. In the past we’ve been much farther behind.” What do I care about the balance sheet? I almost laughed right in his face, but one has to pretend. “Muñoz, do you think that we’ll ever finish? Be aware the excess profit entries are next, and those pests reject the sworn declarations three or four times, and then of course, we start to choke on the work. We have to hurry, Muñoz, this is my last balance sheet and I want it to turn out just right. Tell the fellows, okay?”
