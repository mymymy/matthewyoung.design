		<h3>Tuesday, September 10th</h3>

		<p>
			It was tremendous. At two forty-five, Gaizolo arrived in the office from the street and in a loud voice said: “Fuck, goddamn it. I had been playing number 1 up until last Saturday, and it just comes out today.” The first predictable question came from the back of the office: “So the last digit of the number is 1? Do you remember both numbers?” “01,” replied Gaizolo, in a bad mood. Then, Peña leaped up from behind his desk and said, “Hey, I played 301,” and quickly added, turning towards Menéndez, who works in front of the large window: “Go ahead Menéndez, take a look at the blackboard. If 301 came out, then I really hit the jackpot.” Menéndez appeared to turn his head as slowly as possible, with the attitude of someone who is still restraining himself so as not to be deceived. He saw the large and distinct numbers, 15.301, and for a moment remained paralyzed. I think that at that instant he had weighed all the possibilities and had consequently rejected every possibility of trickery. No one, but him, knew the number. But the itinerary of the trick ended there. The plan required that at that moment, the entire staff would break the news to him that they had played a practical joke on him. But no one had expected that Menéndez would leap up and run to the back of the office. One witness’ version is that he entered the manager’s office (who at that moment was meeting with a representative of an American firm) without knocking, practically threw himself on him, and before the manager could channel his shock, planted a loud kiss on his bald head. I, who was too late in noticing this last turn of events to prevent it, went into the office after him, grabbed him by the arm, and pulled him out by force. There, amongst the boxes of bolts and pistons, and while he shook with several bursts of loud energetic laughter that I’ll never be able to forget, I practically shouted the real truth at him. I felt horrible doing that, but there was no other choice. I’ve never seen a man collapse in such a hopeless and sudden manner. His legs gave way, he opened his mouth without being able to close it, and then afterwards, only afterwards, covered his eyes with his right hand. I sat him down in a chair and then entered the manager’s office to explain the episode to him. But the idiot couldn’t bear the fact that the American representative had witnessed his humiliation and said: “Don’t bother offering me an unbelievable explanation. That imbecile is fired.”

			That’s the horrible thing: he’s really fired, and furthermore, bitter forever. Those five minutes of frantic illusion are going to be indelible. When the others learned the news, they formed a delegation and went to see the manager. But the Crab was inflexible. It must be the saddest, nastiest, and most depressing day in all the years that I’ve spent in the office. However, at the last minute, the brotherhood of cruelty made a gesture: while Menéndez is out of work, each of his co-workers in the Sales Department has decided to contribute a small percentage towards replacing his salary and then presenting it to him. But there was an obstacle: Menéndez doesn’t accept the gift or the act of reparation or whatever anyone wants to call it. He also doesn’t want to talk to anyone from the office. Poor guy. I’m blaming myself for not having warned him since yesterday. But no one could have imagined that he was going to have such an explosive reaction.
