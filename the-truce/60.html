		<h3>Sunday, May 12th</h3>

		<p>
			I also heard her say she goes to the street fair on Sundays. I have to talk to her, so I went to the fair. I thought I saw her two or three times, suddenly spotting part of a neck, hairdo or shoulder that looked like hers amongst the many heads in the crowd. But then, the figure came into full view, and even that familiar appendage would blend with the whole and the similarity would be lost. Every now and then a woman I saw from behind had the same walk, hips, and nape. But then she’d suddenly turn around, and the resemblance would become absurd. The only thing that doesn’t deceive (as a single trait) is the gaze. I didn’t find her eyes anywhere. Nevertheless, (I’ve only just thought about this) I don’t know what they look like, what color they are. I returned home tired, confused, annoyed, and bored. Although, there is a more accurate word to describe it: I returned home alone.
