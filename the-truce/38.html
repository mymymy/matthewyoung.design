		<h3>Thursday, April 11th</h3>

		<p>
			It’s a half an hour before dinner. Vignale is coming over tonight, but only Blanca and I will be here. Jaime and Esteban disappeared as soon as they found out he was coming. I don’t blame them though; I would have escaped, too.
		</p>

		<p>
			A change has come over Blanca. She has color in her cheeks now. And it’s not makeup because she retains this color even after she washes her face. Sometimes she forgets that I’m in the house and starts to sing. She doesn’t have much of a voice, but she uses it well. I like hearing her sing. I wonder what goes through my sons’ heads. Are they in the middle of uphill aspirations?
