		<h3>Saturday, June 22nd</h3>

		<p>
			I didn’t go to the office. I took advantage of yesterday’s joyful chaos and asked the manager for the proper authorization to take the morning off. It was granted with a smile and even with a pleasant and stimulating comment about how they didn’t know how they would manage without the key man of the office. Is it that they want to force Valverde’s daughter on me? Bah.

			I accepted delivery of the furniture in the apartment and worked like a slave. The furniture looks good. Nothing vehemently modern. I don’t like those functional type chairs with ridiculously unstable legs that collapse when you merely look at them angrily, or those chair backs seemingly always made to someone else’s size. I don’t like those lamps that always illuminate things no one has any interest in seeing or displaying, for example: spider webs, cockroaches, light fuses.

			I think that it’s the first time I’ve decorated an apartment to my liking. When I got married, my family gave us the bedroom furniture, and Isabel’s family contributed the dining room set. They weren’t compatible at all, but it doesn’t matter. Later, my mother-in-law would arrive and dictate: “You two need a painting for the living room.” No need to say it twice. The next morning there would appear a still life with sausages, hard cheese, a melon, homemade bread, bottles of beer; in short, a sight that could ruin my appetite for six months. At other times, usually on the occasion of some anniversary, a certain uncle would send us sea gulls to hang up on the bedroom wall, or two pieces of Italian pottery decorated with little queer valets that were practically repugnant. After Isabel died, and as time, distractions, and the servants finished disposing of the paintings, sea gulls and pottery, Jaime proceeded to fill the house with those grotesque ornaments that need  a periodic explanation. I see them sometimes, Jaime and his friends, reveling in ecstasy in front of a jar that has wings, newspaper clippings, a door, and testicles, and  hear them say: “What a great reproduction!” I don’t understand, nor do I want to, because the truth is their admiration seems hypocritical! One day I asked them: “Why don’t you ever bring home a print of Gauguin, Monet, or Renoir? Are they terrible, perhaps?” Then, Danielito Gómez Ferrando, a good-for-nothing who goes to bed every day at five o’clock in the morning because “the evening hours are the most authentic,” a weakling who doesn’t set foot in a restaurant after having seen someone in there use a toothpick, he, precisely he, replied: “But sir, we‘re interested in the Abstract.” He, on the other hand, isn’t abstract at all, with his little face without eyebrows, and his eternal expression of a little pregnant cat.
