		<h3>Sunday, August 4th</h3>

		<p>
			This morning I opened one of the drawers of the small closet and a surprising amount of photographs, clippings, letters, receipts, and notes fell and scattered all over the floor. Then I saw a piece of paper of unspecified color (its original color was probably green, but now it had a few dark stains and permanently dried running ink from long ago). Until that moment, I didn’t remember at all that the letter existed, but once I saw it I recognized Isabel’s letter. Isabel and I wrote very few letters to each other. Actually, there was never any reason to, as we were never apart for very long. The letter was dated 17 October 1935, Tacuarembó. I felt a little strange seeing those thin letters, with long and fine strokes, in which it was possible to recognize a person and also an era. It was obvious the letter had not been written with a fountain pen, but with one of those little dipping quills that, no sooner did you force them to write, would complain silently and even spew almost invisible droplets of violet ink all around them. I have to transcribe that letter into this diary. I have to do it because it is a part of me, of my unexchangeable past. The letter was written to me under very special circumstances and its rereading has shaken me up a bit, made me doubt a few things,  and I would even add that it has moved me. It says the following: “My Dear: It’s been three weeks since I arrived here. Translate this as: I’ve been sleeping alone for three weeks. Don’t you think that’s awful? You know that sometimes I wake up during the night and I have the absolute need to touch you, to feel you next to me. I don’t know what it is about you that’s so comforting, but knowing you’re next to me makes me feel protected in my semi-sleep. Now I have terrible nightmares, but without monsters. They’re only about dreaming in bed alone, without you. And when I wake up and drive the nightmare away, it turns out I really am in bed alone, without you. The only difference is that in the dream I can’t cry, but when I wake up, I do. Why is this happening to me? After all, I know you’re in Montevideo, that you’re taking care of yourself, that you’re thinking of me. You do think of me, don’t you? Esteban and Blanca are fine, although you must know that Aunt Zulma spoils them terribly. Be prepared, because when we get home, Blanca isn’t going to let us sleep for a few nights. My God, when are those nights going to arrive? By the way, I have some news. I’m pregnant again. It’s terrible to tell you this and not have you kiss me. Or is it not too terrible for you? It’s going to be a boy and we’ll name him Jaime. I like names that being with a J. I don’t know why, but this time I’m a little scared. I mean, what if I die? Please write to me immediately telling me no, I’m not going to die. Have you already thought about what you would do if I died? Well, you’re brave, you’ll know how to defend yourself; and besides, you’ll find someone else right away; I’m dreadfully jealous of her already. You see how neurotic I am? It’s that it’s very painful not to have you here, or you not have me there, it’s the same thing. Don’t laugh; you always laugh at everything, even when there’s nothing to laugh about. Don’t laugh, don’t be mean. Write to me saying I’m not going to die. Even as a lost soul, I couldn’t stop missing you. Oh, before I forget: please call Maruja and remind her that Dora’s birthday is on the 22nd. Tell her to say hello for both of us. Is the house very messy? Did the cleaning woman who Celia recommended show up? Don’t you look at her too much, all right? Aunt Zulma is happy to have the kids here. And as for Uncle Eduardo, what can I say.... Both of them tell me long stories about when you were ten years old and would spend your vacations here. It seems that you became famous for having an answer for everything. A terrific young man, says Uncle Eduardo. I think you’re still a terrific young man, even when you come home tired from the office with a bit of resentment in your eyes and treat me indifferently, sometimes with hatred. But at night we have a good time, don’t we? It’s been raining for the last three days and I sit next to the living room balcony and look out into the street. But not a single soul passes by. When the kids are asleep I go to Uncle Eduardo’s desk and entertain myself by reading the Hispanic-American Dictionary, patently expanding my culture and increasing my boredom in the process. Will it be a boy or a girl? If it’s a girl you can name her, provided that you don’t name her Leonor. But no. It’s going to be a boy and he’ll be called Jaime. He’ll have a long face like yours, be very ugly, and be very successful with women. Look, I like children, I love them very much, but what I like most is that they be your children. Now it’s raining frantically on the cobblestone streets. I’m going to play five stack solitaire; the game that Dora taught me, remember? If I win, it means I’m not going to die in labor. I love you, I love you, I love you, your Isabel. P.S. No cards left, I won! Hurray!”

			How defenseless this enthusiasm seems after twenty-two years! Nevertheless, it was legitimate, honest, and true. It’s interesting how after rereading Isabel’s letter I’ve found her face again, that face which, despite all my forgetfulness, was in my memory. And I found it by way of those “you’s,” “can’s,” and “have’s,” because Isabel never used personal pronouns, and not because of any conviction she might have had, but merely out of habit, or perhaps some mania. I read those “you’s” and I could immediately reconstruct the mouth that said them. And Isabel’s mouth was the most important part of her face. The letter is like she was: a little chaotic, permanently vacillating between optimism and pessimism and vice versa, always about lovemaking in bed, apprehensive, and unsteady. Poor Isabel. The child was a boy and was named Jaime, but she died from an eclamptic convulsion a few hours after giving birth. Jaime doesn’t have a long face like me. He isn’t ugly at all, but his success with women is temporary, and moreover, useless. Poor Isabel. She thought by winning at solitaire, she had persuaded destiny, but in fact she had only provoked it. Everything is so very, very remote. Even Isabel’s husband, the recipient of that 1935 letter who was myself, even he is now remote, and I don’t know whether it’s good or bad. “Don’t laugh,” she says and then repeats it. And it was true: I would always laugh back then, then and she didn’t like it. She didn’t like the wrinkles that would form next to my eyes when I laughed, didn’t find the cause of my laughter amusing, nor could she avoid feeling annoyed and aggressive when I laughed. When we were with other people and I laughed, she would look at me with censoring eyes that anticipated the subsequent reproach when we were alone: “Please don’t laugh, you look horrible.” When she died, laughter vacated my mouth. For a year I felt overwhelmed by three things: pain, work, and the children. Later, my poise, self-confidence, and composure returned. But the laughter didn’t. Well, of course, sometimes I laugh, but only for a special reason or because I consciously want to laugh, and this is very rare. On the other hand, that laugh which was practically a tic, a permanent gesture, didn’t return. Sometimes I think it’s a pity Isabel isn’t around to see me so serious; she would have really enjoyed seeing how serious I am now. But, maybe if Isabel were here, with me, I wouldn’t have been cured of my laughter. Poor Isabel. I realize now that I didn’t speak to her very often. Sometimes I couldn’t find anything to talk to her about; actually, we didn’t have very much in common apart from the children, the creditors, and sex. But it was never necessary to talk about this last topic. Our evenings were already quite eloquent. Was that love? I’m not sure. It’s likely that if our marriage hadn’t ended after five years, we would have realized much later on that sex was only one of its ingredients. And perhaps not too much later, either. But during those five years it was an ingredient which managed to keep us together, firmly together. Now, with Avellaneda, sex is (at least for me) a less important ingredient, less vital; much more important and vital are our conversations, and our natural affinities. But I don’t get excited. I’m well aware that I’m 49 years old now, and when Isabel died I was 28. I’m absolutely certain that if Isabel were to appear now, the same Isabel of 1935 who wrote me a letter from Tacuarembó, an Isabel with black hair, probing eyes, firm hips, and perfect legs, I’m sure I would say: “What a pity,” and I would go looking for Avellaneda.
