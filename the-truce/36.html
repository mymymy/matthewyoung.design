		<h3>Tuesday, April 9th</h3>

		<p>
			Blockhead Vignale called me this morning. I asked someone to tell him I wasn’t in the office, but when he called again in the afternoon I felt obliged to speak to him. Regarding this, I am categorical: if I have this relationship (I don’t dare call it a friendship) perhaps it’s because I deserve it.

			He wants to come to the house. “It’s a private matter, friend. I can’t discuss it over the phone, nor can I invite you over to my house to discuss it, either,” said Vignale. We agreed to meet on Thursday night. He’ll come after dinner.
