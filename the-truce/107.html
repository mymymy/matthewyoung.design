			“Perhaps, in the beginning, when we first began our relationship, I would have preferred it. Now I don’t think so.” I write that first, because I’m afraid I’m going to forget it. That was her reply. Because this time, I was completely honest; the subject of marriage was discussed until it was exhausted. “Before we came here, to this apartment, I noticed it was painful for you to say that word,” she said. “One day you said it, in the entrance hall of my house, and you have my deepest gratitude for having done so. It helped me to decide, to believe in you, in your love. But I couldn’t accept it, because it would have been a  false foundation for this present, which at that time was the future. If I had accepted it, I also would have had to accept that you give in, that you forced yourself to a decision for which you were not prepared. Instead, I gave in, but, as it stands to reason, I can be more certain about my own reactions that I can be about yours. I knew that even though I was giving in, I wouldn’t hold a grudge against you, but on the other hand, if I forced you to give in, I didn’t know if you would hold a bit of a grudge against me. But now that’s all past. I am no longer chaste. There is   something ancestral in women that causes them to defend their virginity, to make demands and to demand of herself the maximum guarantees to contain her losses. Afterwards, when you are no longer chaste, you realize that everything was a myth, an old legend used to snare husbands. That’s why I tell you that now I’m not sure that marriage would be our best solution. The important thing is that we both be united for something: that something exists, doesn’t it? Well now, don’t you think it more powerful, much stronger, and more beautiful if what unites us is that something which really exists, and not just a simple formality; the ritual speech of a hurried and potbellied judge? Furthermore, there are your children. I don’t want to appear as if I want to compete for your life with the image of your wife; I don’t want them to feel jealous in representation of their mother. And finally, there’s your fear of time, that you’ll become old and I’ll go looking elsewhere. Don’t be so sensitive. What I like most about you is something which won’t go away with the passage of time.” More than her truths, it was my desires she was enunciating so calmly. And how pleasant they were to hear.
