			“I bet you don’t know who I bumped into,” said Vignale over the telephone. My silence was, without a doubt, so provocative he couldn’t even wait three second to offer the answer: “Just imagine, Escayola.” I thought about it. Escayola? It’s strange to hear that name again, the kind of old family name you just don’t hear anymore. “You don’t say,” I replied. “And how is he?”

			“He looks like a dolphin and weighs 215 lbs.,” Vignale replied. Well, it turns out that Escayola found out Vignale had bumped into me and, naturally, there is a dinner in the future.

			Escayola. He’s also from the Brandzen Street era. But him I remember. As a teenager, he was scrawny, tall, and nervous; he was quick to make fun of everything and his chatter was usually hilarious. In the café owned by the “gallego” Alvarez, Escayola was the star. Apparently, we were all predisposed to laughter because Escayola would say just about anything (it didn’t necessarily have to be funny) and we were immediately tempted to laugh. I remember that sometimes we would hold our stomachs, screaming with laughter. I think the secret lay in that he would act funny, but with great seriousness: a kind of Buster Keaton. It will be good to see him again.
