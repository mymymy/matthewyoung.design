		<h3>Monday, August 26th</h3>

			I told Esteban. Blanca had left to have lunch with Diego, so he and I were alone at midday. It was a great relief to learn that he already knew. Jaime had told him. “Look Dad, I can’t completely understand it nor do I think that getting involved with a woman who is much younger than you is the best answer. But one thing is true: I don’t dare judge you. I know that when one sees matters objectively, when one is not involved in them, it’s very easy to proclaim what’s good and what’s bad. But when one is up to one’s neck in the problem (and I’ve been in that position many times), things change, the intensity is different, and deep convictions, inevitable sacrifices, and renouncements appear, which can seem inexplicable to the mere observer. I hope you have a nice time, not superficially, but in a deeper sense. I hope you feel like the protector and the protected at the same time, which is one of the most pleasant feelings  the human being can allow itself to have. I remember very little about mom. Actually, she’s a true image onto which the images and memories of others have been superimposed. I no longer know which one of those memories is exclusively mine. Well, perhaps just one: her in the bathroom, combing her hair, the long, dark tresses falling down her back. You can see that there’s not very much I remember about her. But over the years I’ve become accustomed to thinking of her as something ideal, unreachable, almost ethereal. She was so pretty, wasn’t she? I realize that maybe my portrayal of her has little to do with what she was truly like. Nevertheless, that’s how she exists for me. That’s why I was a bit shocked when Jaime told me that you were involved with a young woman. It shocked me, but I accept it, because I know you were very lonely. And I realize it even more now, because I’ve followed your progress and I’ve seen you become renewed. So, I don’t judge you, I can’t judge you; and furthermore, I would very much like it if you’ve made the right choice and get as close as possible to good luck.”
