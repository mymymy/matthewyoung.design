		<h3>Wednesday, February 27th</h3>

		<p>
			Today, seven new employees joined the office: four men and three women. They all had a splendid frightened look on their faces and every now and then directed a glance of respectful envy at the veteran workers. I was assigned two young men (one 18 years old and the other 22) and a young woman, 24 years of age. So now I’m truly a boss: I have no less than six employees working under me. And for the first time, a woman. I’ve never trusted women with numbers. Furthermore, there’s another drawback: during the days of their menstrual period and even the day before, if they are normally intelligent, they become a little silly; if they are normally a little silly, they become complete imbeciles. These “rookies” who started today don’t look bad. The 18 year old is the one I like the least. He has a weak, delicate face, and a shifty, yet fawning look about him.  The other one is eternally disheveled, but he has a pleasant disposition and (at least for now) a genuine interest in working. The young woman doesn’t seem too interested, but at least she understands what is explained to her; and furthermore, has a wide face and a large mouth, two features that generally impress me. Their names are Alfredo Santini, Rodolfo Sierra and Laura Avellaneda. I’ll assign the two men to the merchandise books, and the woman to the Production Assistant.
