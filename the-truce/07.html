		<h3>Saturday, February 23rd</h3>

		<p>
			Today I lunched alone downtown. As I was walking along Mercedes, I came across a man dressed in brown. At first he feigned a wave. I should have looked at him suspiciously, because the man stopped and with some indecision, extended his hand. His face wasn’t an unfamiliar face. It was like a caricature of someone who I, in the past, would have seen often. I shook his hand, mumbling my apologies, and somehow managed to admit my confusion. “Martín Santomé?” he said, displaying a ruined set of teeth in his smile. Sure, I’m Martín Santomé, I thought, as I was becoming more and more confused. “Don’t you remember Brandzen Street?” Well, not very well, I thought. It’s been about thirty years and I’m not famous for my memory. Naturally, as a bachelor I lived on Brandzen Street, but even if I were given a thrashing I couldn’t say what the front of the house looked like, how many balconies it had, or who lived next door. “And the café on Defensa Street?” Now the fog cleared a bit and for a moment I saw the belly and wide belt of the “gallego” Alvarez. “Of course, of course,” I exclaimed, enlightened. “Well, I’m Mario Vignale,” he said. Mario Vignale? I don’t remember, I swear I don’t remember, I continued thinking. But I didn’t have the courage to tell him. After all, the man seemed so enthusiastic about the encounter.... So I told him I remembered him, to please forgive me, that I was terrible with faces; so much so that last week I had bumped into a cousin and had not recognized him (a lie). Naturally, we had to have coffee, and so my Saturday siesta was spoiled. For two hours and fifteen minutes he persisted in reconstructing details to convince me he had been a part of my life. “I even remember that sensational artichoke omelet your mother used to make. I always came by at eleven-thirty to see if she would invite me to eat.” And then he let out a big laugh. “Always?” I asked him, still suspicious. Then he was suddenly embarrassed and said: “Well, I went three or four times.” Now then, which part was true? I asked silently. “And your mother, is she all right?” “She died fifteen years ago,” I replied. “Damn, and your father?” “He died two years ago, in Tacuarembó,” I replied. “He was staying at my Aunt Leonor’s house.” “He must have been old.” Of course he was old, I thought. My God, how dull. Only then did he ask the most logical question: “Hey, did you finally marry Isabel?” “Yes, and I have three children,” I replied, being brief. He has five. What luck. “And how is Isabel? Still attractive?” “She died,” I said, assuming the most inscrutable facial expression in my repertory. The words sounded like a gunshot and he – thank goodness – became confused. He rushed to finish his third coffee and immediately looked at his watch. There is a sort of automatic reflex to talk about death and then immediately look at one’s watch.
