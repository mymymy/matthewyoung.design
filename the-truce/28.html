		<h3>Saturday, March 30th</h3>

		<p>
			Robledo is still angry with me because he had to work late this past Wednesday. Poor guy. From what Muñoz told me this morning, Robledo’s girlfriend is frightfully jealous. On Wednesday he was supposed to meet her at eight, but because I had chosen him to work late, he couldn’t go. He called her and explained, but it was no use. She didn’t believe him and told him that she never wanted to see him again. Muñoz says that he consoles Robledo by telling him that it’s always better to know about these drawbacks before getting married, but Robledo is still terribly angry. Today, I called him over and told him that I didn’t know about the situation with his girlfriend. I asked him why he hadn’t told me about it before, and he looked at me with sparks shooting from his eyes, and murmured: “You were quite aware of it. I’m sick of all your little jokes.” He sneezed, out of pure nervousness, and quickly added, with an ample gesture of disappointment: “That they, who are terribly crass, can say those jokes about me, I understand. But that you, who is every bit a serious man, would encourage them, honestly disappoints me a little. I’ve never told you, but I had a good opinion of you.” I was feeling a bit awkward about having to defend his good opinion of me, so without a trace of irony I told him: “Look, believe me if you want to, and if you don’t, too bad. I didn’t know anything and that’s the end of it. Now get to work if you don’t want me to be disappointed, too.”
