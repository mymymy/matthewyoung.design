		<h3>Friday, September 6th</h3>

		<p>
			I saw Vignale in the pastry shop. He was quite hidden away in the back, sitting at a table with a very flamboyant girl. He greeted me with a sweeping gesture, as if to confirm that he’s thrown himself into these affairs on a large scale. The way they looked, from afar, made me feel sorry for them. Suddenly, I found myself thinking: “And what about me?” Of course, Vignale is vulgar, pompous, and crass...But what about me? How do I look to whoever might observe me from afar? Avellaneda and I don’t go out very often. Our life together takes place in the office and in the apartment. I’m afraid that my resistance to going out with her is, more than anything, based on a guarded fear of looking bad. No, it can’t be. There was a moment during which Vignale was talking to the waiter when the girl shot a harsh, scornful look at him. Avellaneda could not look at me like that.
