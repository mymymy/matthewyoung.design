		<h3>Monday, June 10th</h3>

		<p>
			Cold and wind. How foul. To think that when I was fifteen years old I liked the winter. Now I start to sneeze and lose count. I often have the feeling that instead of a nose, I have a ripe tomato, with that ripeness tomatoes have ten seconds before they begin to rot. As I sneeze for the thirty-fifth time, I can’t avoid feeling inferior to the rest of mankind. I admire the noses of saints, for example, those thin and unencumbered noses of, for example, the saints of El Greco. I admire the noses of saints because they (it’s evident) never had a cold, or were decimated by a string of sneezes. Never. If they had sneezed in sequences of twenty or thirty consecutive outbursts, they wouldn’t have been able to avoid completely surrendering to cursing out loud or to themselves. And whoever curses – even during their most simplified terrible thinking – is closing off their path to Glory.
