		<h3>Friday, August 23rd</h3>

			I wanted to surprise her. I waited for her a block away from the office. At five past seven I saw her approaching. But she was walking with Robledo. I don’t know what Robledo was telling her; but the truth is that she was laughing freely, very amused. Since when is Robledo so amusing? I went into a café, let them pass by and then started to follow them some thirty steps behind. When they reached Andes they said good-bye. Then, she turned towards San José. She was going to the apartment, of course. I went into a grimy little café where I was served a cortado in a cup that still had lipstick on it. I didn’t drink it, but I didn’t complain to the waiter, either. I was agitated, nervous, and uneasy, but overall, annoyed with myself. Avellaneda laughing with Robledo. What was wrong with that? Avellaneda in a simple human relationship, not merely professional, with a man other than myself. Avellaneda walking along the street with a young man, someone from her generation, and not an old weakling like me. Avellaneda far away from me, Avellaneda living on her own. Of course there was nothing wrong with any of that. But perhaps this horrible sensation stems from the fact that this is the first time I consciously foresee the possibility that Avellaneda could live, develop and laugh, without my help (not to mention my love) being necessary. I knew that the conversation between her and Robledo had been innocent. Or maybe not. Because Robledo has no way of knowing she’s not available. How idiotic, how pretentious, how conventional I feel when I write: “She’s not available.” Available for what? Perhaps the essence of my uneasiness is having verified the following, and nothing else: that she could feel very comfortable with young people, especially with a young man. And another thing: what I saw is nothing, but on the other hand, what I glimpsed was quite a bit, and what I glimpsed was the risk of losing everything. Robledo doesn’t interest her. Deep down, he’s a frivolous man who would never interest her. Unless, I don’t know her at all. Well, do I know her? Robledo doesn’t interest her. But, what about the others, all the others in the world? If a young man makes her laugh, how many others could win her love? If one day she loses me (her only enemy could be death, the malicious death which has all our numbers), she would have her whole life, time on her hands, she would have her heart, which will always be new, generous, and splendid. But if one day I lose her (my only enemy is the Man, the Man who is young and strong and holds promise), I would also be losing the last opportunity to live,  the last respite of time; because if my heart now feels generous, happy, and renewed, without her it would return to being an unquestionably old heart.

			I paid for the cortado that I didn’t drink and headed for the apartment. I was carrying a shameful fear of her silence, especially because I knew beforehand that even if she didn’t say anything, I wasn’t going to pry, ask, or reproach. I was just simply going to swallow my bitterness, and, that was certain, begin a period of small storms without relief. I have a particular distrust for my gray periods. I think my hand was shaking when I turned the key in the lock. “Why are you home so late?” she shouted from the kitchen. “I was waiting for you to tell you about Robledo’s latest crazy act, what a character! It’s been years since I’ve laughed so much.” And she appeared in the living room with her apron, her green skirt, her black jersey, her eyes clear, warm, and sincere. She could never know how she was saving me with those words. I pulled her to me, and as I hugged her, as I breathed in the tenderly natural scent of her shoulders through that other, universal, scent of wool, I felt the world was beginning to turn again, that I could once again relegate that real threat that had been called Avellaneda and the Others, to a distant, still nameless future. “Avellaneda and I,” I said slowly. She didn’t understand the reason for those three words at that particular moment, but some obscure intuition made her realize that something important was happening. She pulled away from me a little, but still without letting go, and said: “Let’s see, say it again.” “Avellaneda and I,” I repeated, obediently. Now I’m alone, here at home, and it’s almost two o’clock in the morning. Every now and then, for no other reason than it gives me strength, uplifts me, and anchors me, I keep repeating: “Avellaneda and I.”
