		<h3>Thursday, September 5th</h3>

		<p>
			I think we both feel the same way about this: we have an overbearing need to tell each other everything. I talk to her as if I was talking to myself; actually, it’s even better than if I was talking to myself. It’s as if Avellaneda was part of my soul, was curled up in a corner of my soul, waiting for my revelations, demanding my sincerity. On her part, Avellaneda tells me everything too. In another time, I know I would have noted: “At least that’s what I think.” But now I can’t write that, simply because it wouldn’t be true. Now I know she tells me everything.
