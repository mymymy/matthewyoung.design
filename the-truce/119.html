		<h3>Friday, August 16th</h3>

		<p>
			A really uncomfortable situation. I had met Aníbal at seven-thirty, and after chatting for a while in the café, we took the trolley. Even though he gets off before I do, it’s convenient for him, too. We talked about women, marriage, fidelity, etc. All in very broad and general terms. I spoke in a very low voice because I’ve always been suspicious of other people’s roaming ears; but Aníbal, even when he wants to whisper, does so with a thundering blast which inundates his surroundings. I don’t know what specific topic we were discussing, but standing next to him, in the aisle, was an old woman with a square face and a round hat. I realized she was hanging on Aníbal’s every word, but because what he was saying was very uplifting, very petit bourgeois, very moral without extenuating circumstances, I wasn’t too concerned. Nevertheless, when Aníbal got off and the old woman stepped by and took his seat next to me, the first thing she said to me was: “Don’t listen to that wicked man.” And before I could articulate a stunned: “What did you say?” the old woman was already continuing: “A really wicked man. Those are the kind who ruin homes. Oh, you men. How easily you condemn women! Look, I can assure you that when a woman goes astray, there always exists a villainous, foolish, denigrating man who first caused her to lose faith in herself.” The old woman was now shouting, which caused all the heads in the bus to turn in an effort to look at the recipient of such a scolding. I felt like an insect. And the old woman continued: “I’m a batllista*, but I’m opposed to divorce. Divorce is what has destroyed the family. Do you know what’s going to happen to that wicked man who was giving you advice? Oh, you don’t know. Well, I do. That man is going to end up in jail or committing suicide. And he would be right to do that, because I know men who should be burned alive.” I envisioned the unusual image of Aníbal being scorched in a bonfire. Only then did I have the courage to respond: “Tell me, lady, why don’t you shut up? What do you know about it? What that man was saying is exactly the opposite of what you’ve understood....” And then the old woman, unaffected by my response, replied: “Just look at the families of long ago. Morality existed then. In the evenings, one could pass by and see the husband, the wife, and the children; all of them sensible, decent, and well educated, sitting outside in front of their homes. That’s happiness, sir, and not allowing the woman to lose her way, to give herself to a life of debauchery. Because deep down, no woman is bad, understand?” And as she shouted and pointed her index finger at me, her hat tilted a little to the left. I have to admit that that ideal image of happiness, with the entire family sitting outside in front of the house, didn’t really move me very much. “Don’t listen to him, mister. Laugh, what you have to do is laugh,” she said. “And why don’t you laugh, instead of becoming so angry?” I said. Meanwhile, the people on the bus had started to make remarks. The old woman had her supporters, and I had mine. When I say “I”, I’m referring to that hypothetical and ghostly enemy against whom she directed her insults. “And remember that I’m a batllista, but I’m opposed to divorce,” she repeated. And then, before she could begin her ominous cycle again, I excused myself and got off, ten blocks before my destination.
