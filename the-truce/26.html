		<h3>Thursday, March 28th</h3>

		<p>
			I had a long talk with Esteban and expressed my doubts about the fairness of his appointment. For God’s sake, I didn’t expect him to quit; I know that is no longer fashionable. I simply would have liked to have heard him say he felt uncomfortable about his appointment. But he didn’t. “It’s useless, Dad. You keep living in the past.” That’s what he said. “These days nobody gets offended if some nobody appears and passes them on their way up the ladder. And do you know why nobody gets offended? Because they would do the same thing if they had the opportunity. I'm sure they aren’t going to look at me with anger, but with envy.”
