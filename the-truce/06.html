		<h3>Friday, February 22nd</h3>

		<p>
			When I retire, I don’t think I’ll continue to write this diary. By then, there is no doubt that many less things will happen to me and then it will be unbearable for me to feel so bored, and furthermore, to leave a record of it. When I retire, perhaps it would be best to give myself up to leisure, a kind of drowsy compensation, in order for my nerves, muscles and willpower to slowly relax and become accustomed to dying well. But no. There are moments when I have and maintain the luxurious hope that retirement will be something full, rich; the last opportunity to find myself. And that would really be worth writing down.
