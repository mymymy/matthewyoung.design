		<h3>Saturday, July 20th</h3>

		<p>
			Blanca brought me the envelope. The letter says the following: “Dad: I know that you want to talk and I already know what’s on your mind. You’re going to preach morality and there are two reasons why I can’t accept your preaching. The first is that I have nothing to be ashamed of. The second, that you have a secret life, too. I’ve seen you with that girl who has ensnared you, and I think you would agree that it’s not the best way to show proper respect for mom’s memory. But that unilateral puritanism is your business. Since I don’t like what you do and you don’t like what I do, the best thing for me to do is disappear. Therefore, I’ll disappear. Now you have a clear field. I’m of age, so don’t worry. I imagine, besides, that my retreat will bring you closer to my siblings. Blanca knows everything (for more information, see her); I told Esteban myself, yesterday afternoon, in his office. For your peace of mind, I must admit that he reacted every inch the macho man and left me with a black eye. The one that’s still open enables me to see the future (it’s not so terrible, you’ll see) and direct a last look at my charming family, so fastidious, so formal. Regards, Jaime.” I handed the letter to Blanca. She then read it slowly and said: “He’s already taken his things. This morning.” She looked pale when she added: “And this woman business, is it true?” “Yes and no,” I said. “It’s true that I’m having a relationship with a woman, a young girl almost. I live with her. On the  other hand, it’s not true this signifies an offense to your mother’s memory. It seems to me I have the right to love someone. I haven’t married her only because I’m not sure it would be the most convenient thing to do.” Perhaps this last remark wasn’t necessary. I’m not too sure. Her lips were pressed together. I think she was vacillating between an ancestral loyalty to family and a very simple sense of what is human. “But, is she a good person?” she asked, eagerly. “Yes, she is,” I replied. She breathed a sigh of relief, signifying she still trusts me. I too breathed a sigh of relief about feeling capable of inciting that trust. And then I acted on a sudden inspiration and said: “Is it too much to ask you to meet her?” “I was going to ask you that myself,” she replied. I didn’t say anything, but the gratitude was in my throat.
