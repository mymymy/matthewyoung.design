		<h3>Sunday, May 5th</h3>

		<p>
			Aníbal has changed. I always had the secret impression he was going to stay young until eternity. But it looks like eternity arrived because he doesn’t look young anymore. He’s decayed physically (he’s skinny, his bones are more noticeable, his clothes are big on him, his moustache is somewhat ragged), but it’s not only that. From the tone of his voice, which sounds much gloomier than I remember, to the movement of his hands which have lost their liveliness; from the look on his face, which at first appeared sluggish but then I later realized was merely disenchantment, to his topics of conversation, which used to be scintillating and are now incredibly dull. Everything combines to form a single conclusion: Aníbal has lost his joy of living.
		</p>

		<p>
			He hardly talked about himself, that is to say, he only talked about himself superficially. Apparently, he raised some money and wants to start his own business, but is still undecided about what kind. And yes, he continues to be interested in politics.
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s not my forte. I realized this when he began to ask questions which were increasingly incisive, as if he were looking for explanations for things he can’t quite understand. I realized I didn’t have an actual formed opinion about those minor topics which one sometimes includes in office or coffee shop chatter, or about which one vaguely thinks about in passing while reading the newspaper during breakfast. Aníbal forced me to form an opinion and I think I started asserting myself as I responded. He asked me if I thought everything was better or worse than it was five years ago, when he left. “Worse,” replied my body cells unanimously. But later I had to explain. Ugh, what a task!
		</p>

		<p>
			In reality, there were always bribes, job arrangements via influence peddling, and bureaucracies, as well. So, what’s worse then? After greatly wracking my brain, I arrived at the belief that what is worse is the resignation. The rebels have become semi-rebels, and the semi-rebels have become resigned. I think that in this luminous Montevideo, the two associations which have progressed the most in recent times are the homosexuals and the resigned. “Nothing can be done,” people say. Before, someone would only offer a bribe if they wanted to obtain something illicit. That’s one thing, but now, someone who wants to obtain something that’s not illegal also offers a bribe. And this means total disorder.
		</p>

		<p>
			But resignation isn’t the complete truth. In the beginning it was resignation, then, the abandonment of scruples; much later, of joint participation. It was a man who had formerly resigned who delivered the famous phrase: “If the ones upstairs can do it, so can I.” Naturally, this man has an excuse for his dishonesty: it’s the only way the others won’t take advantage of him. He says he was forced to play the game, because otherwise his money was worth less and less and there were more and more honest paths being blocked off to him. He still maintains a vindictive, latent hatred towards those pioneers who forced him to follow that path. Perhaps he is, after all is said and done, the most hypocritical, because he doesn’t do anything to get out of his situation. Perhaps he’s also the biggest thief, because he knows perfectly well that no one dies of honesty.

			What it is like to be unaccustomed to thinking about all of this! Aníbal left at dawn and I felt so restless I didn’t want to think about Avellaneda.
