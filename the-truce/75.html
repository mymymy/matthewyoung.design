		<h3>Tuesday, June 4th</h3>

			Great. The Valverde woman broke up with Suárez and the entire office is in an upheaval. Martínez’ face was a poem. For him the break up meant, plain and simple, the assistant manager job. Suárez didn’t come to work this morning, but showed up in the afternoon with a bruise on his forehead and a funereal look on his face. The manager called him over and reprimanded him loudly. That means it’s not just a simple rumor, but in fact an official and authorized version.
