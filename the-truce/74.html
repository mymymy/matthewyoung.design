		<h3>Sunday, June 2nd</h3>

		<p>
			Time flies. Sometimes I think I should live hurriedly instead of trying to get the most out of these remaining years. These days, after having scrutinized my wrinkles, anyone can say to me: “But you’re still a young man.” Still. But how many years of “still,” do I have left? I think about it and start to hurry, and have the agonizing sensation that life is slipping away from me, as if my veins had opened and I couldn’t stop the bleeding. Because life is many things (work, money, luck, friendship, health, complications) and no one is going to deny that when we think about the word Life, when we say for example: “we cling to life,” we are likening it to a more specific, attractive and surely more important word: Pleasure. I think about pleasure (any kind of pleasure) and I’m sure that’s what life is. From then on it’s the hurrying, the tragic hurrying of these fifty years which are fast on my heels. I still have, I hope, a few years of friendship, passable health, routine desires, and hope for good luck still remaining. But, how many years of pleasure are left? I was twenty years old and I was young; I was thirty and I was young; I was forty and I was young. Now I’m fifty years old and I’m “young still.” “Still” means  that it ends.

			And that’s the absurd part of our agreement: we say we’re going to take it easy, let time pass, and then afterwards, we’ll review the situation. But time passes, whether we allow it to or not, and each day makes her more desirable, mature, feminine, and buxom, while on the other hand, each day threatens me with becoming more ill, worn-out, less courageous, and less indispensable. We have to hurry towards the encounter, because in our case the future is an inevitable non-encounter. All of her pluses correspond to my minuses and all of her minuses correspond to my pluses. I understand that for a young woman it can be an inducement to know that one is someone who has lived, exchanged his innocence for experience a long time ago, and thinks with his head well set on his shoulders. It’s possible that would be an attraction, but how brief. Because experience is good when it arrives hand in hand with vigor; afterwards, when the strength is gone, one becomes a decorous museum piece, whose only value is being a reminder of what once existed. Experience and strength are contemporaries for a very short time. I’m now at that stage. But it’s not an enviable situation.
