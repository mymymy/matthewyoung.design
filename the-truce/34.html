		<h3>Saturday, April 6th</h3>

		<p>
			A wild dream. I had just walked through Aliados Park dressed in my pajamas, when all of a sudden I saw Avellaneda standing on the sidewalk of a luxurious two-story house. I approached without hesitating. She was wearing a plain dress, without any embellishments or a belt, resting directly on her flesh. She was sitting on a little kitchen bench next to a eucalyptus tree, peeling potatoes. I suddenly realized it was already night time and I approached and said: “What a wonderful aroma of countryside.” Apparently, my reasoning was decisive, because I immediately became dedicated to possessing her, without any intervening resistance on her part.

			This morning, when Avellaneda appeared wearing a plain dress, without any embellishments or a belt, I couldn’t restrain myself and said: “What a wonderful aroma of countryside.” She looked at me in a genuine panic, exactly the same way one looks at a lunatic or a drunk. To make matters worse, I tried to explain that I was talking to myself. I didn’t convince her, and when she left at noon, she was still watching me with a certain wariness. Just further proof that it’s possible to be more convincing in dreams than in reality.
