		<h3>Sunday, May 19th</h3>

		<p>
			I waited for her at Mercedes and Río Branco. She was only ten minutes late. Her tailored Sunday suit improved her looks quite a bit, although I was probably especially predisposed to find her looking better and better every time we meet. Today she was nervous. Her little suit was a good omen (she wanted to make a good impression); but her nerves weren’t. I had the feeling that beneath her rouge, her cheeks and lips were pale. In the restaurant she chose an almost hidden table in the back. “She doesn’t want to be seen with me. This is a bad omen,” I thought. No sooner did she sit down, than she opened her purse, took out her little mirror and looked at herself. “She is careful about her looks. That’s a good sign,” I thought. This time we talked about generalities for fifteen minutes (during which time we ordered a cold dish of meat and vegetables, wine, and spread butter on the black bread). All of a sudden, she said: “Please, don’t shoot me those looks of expectation.” “I don’t have any other kind,” I replied, like an idiot. “You want to know my answer,” she continued, “and my answer is another question.” “Then ask it,” I said. “What does it mean, that you’re in love with me?” It had never occurred to me that such a question existed, but there it was, within my reach. “Please, Avellaneda, don’t make me look even more ridiculous than I already do,” I said. “Do you want me to specify like an adolescent, what it means to be in love?” “No, certainly not,” she replied. “Well then?” I continued. Actually, I was pretending to be naïve; deep down I knew quite well what she was trying to tell me. “Well,” she said, “you don’t want to look ridiculous, but on the other hand, you don’t mind if I look ridiculous. You know what I’m trying to tell you. Being in love could mean, especially in the male jargon, many different things.” “You’re right,” I said. “Then let’s say it’s the best of all those things. Because that’s what I was referring to yesterday when I told you I was in love with you.” It wasn’t a dialogue of love, don’t I wish. The rhythm of our voices sounded like a conversation between merchants, or professors, or politicians, or anyone poised and restrained. “Look,” I continued, a bit more animated, “there exists what is called reality, and what is called appearances.” “Aha,” she said, without appearing to scoff at my remark. “I love you in what is called reality, but the problems arise when I think about that which is called appearances,” I said. “What problems?” she asked, this time sounding truly intrigued. “Don’t make me say I could be your father, or that you’re the same age as one of my children,” I replied. “Don’t make me say it, because that is the key to all the problems and, besides, then I’m really going to feel a bit miserable.” She didn’t say anything, which was good. There was less risk this way. “Do you understand then?” I asked, without waiting for a reply. Then I continued: “My aim, apart from the very understandable desire to be happy, or as close to that as possible, is for you to be happy too. And that’s what is difficult. You have all the traits to share my happiness, but I have very few with which to share yours. And don’t think I’m acting important. Under different circumstances, (I mean, actually in a different age) the proper thing for me to do would be to offer you a serious courtship, very serious, perhaps too serious, with a clear prospect of marriage within arm’s reach. But if I were to offer you something similar now, I think it would be selfish of me, because I would only be thinking of myself, and what I most want now is not to think of myself but to think of you. I can’t forget – and you can’t either – that in ten years I’ll be sixty years old. “Hardly an old man,” an optimist or a toady might say, but the adverb matters very little. I want to remain safely honest when I say that, not now, nor in a few months, will I be able to muster enough strength to talk about marriage. But – there’s always a but – what to talk about then? I know that, however much you understand this, it’s still difficult  to accept another option. Because it’s obvious that another option does exist. There is room for love in that other option, but on the other hand, no room for marriage.” She raised her eyes, but didn’t question me. It’s probable she just wanted to see the look on my face when I made that last remark. But, at this late stage, I was already determined not to hold back, so I continued: “In regards to that other option, the public imagination, which is usually poor at defining denominations, calls it a “fling” or an “arrangement” and so it’s quite logical for you to feel a little frightened. To tell the truth, I’m afraid that you think that I’m proposing we have an affair. Perhaps, I would not be even the slightest bit insincere if I told you that what I’m boldly seeking for is an accord, a kind of agreement between my love and your freedom. I know, I know. You’re thinking that the reality is exactly the opposite; that what I’m looking for is precisely your love and my freedom. You have every right to think this, but realize that at the same time, I have every right to wager everything on this one card. And that one card is the trust you can have in me.” By then, we were waiting for dessert. When the waiter finally brought the heavenly dishes, I took the opportunity to ask for the check. Immediately after the last bite, Avellaneda wiped her mouth vigorously with her napkin and looked at me, smiling. Her smile was forming little rays at the corners of her lips. “I like you,” she said.
