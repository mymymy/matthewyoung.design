		<h3>Saturday, June 15th</h3>

		<p>
			I found an apartment. It’s very close to what I had in mind and incredibly cheap. Still, I’ll have to tighten my budget and hope I can afford it. It’s five blocks away from 18th and Andes, near the Plaza Independencia, and has the advantage of being able to furnish it for forty cents. But that’s just a figure of speech. Actually, I won’t have any other choice but to use my remaining balance of $2,465.79, at the Hipotecario bank.

			Tonight I’ll go out with her. I’m not planning to tell her anything.
