		<h3>Wednesday, April 17th</h3>

		<p>
			Esteban says if I want to retire by the end of the year, we have to begin the process right away. He says he’s going to help me expedite the process, but even so, it’s going to take time. This might mean greasing someone’s palm, and I wouldn’t like that. I know that the person accepting the bribe would be more contemptible than me, but I wouldn’t be innocent either. Esteban’s theory is that it’s necessary to behave in the manner which the environment demands. That which is simply honorable in one environment, could be simply idiotic in another. There is some truth to this, but I’m dismayed that he is right.
