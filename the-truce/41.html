		<h3>Tuesday, April 16th</h3>

			I still haven’t figured out why I’m attracted to Avellaneda. I was observing her today. She moves well, arranges her hair nicely, and has a light, peach-like fuzz on her cheeks. I wonder what she does with her boyfriend? Or better yet, what does her boyfriend do with her? Do they play the decent couple or do they become sexually aroused just like anyone else? A key question for me: envious?
