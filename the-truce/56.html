		<h3>Wednesday, May 8th</h3>

			Vignale again. He was waiting for me outside the office so I had no other choice but to accept his offer to join him for a cup of coffee; an inevitable prologue to an hour of his confessions.
		</p>

		<p>
			He’s radiant. Apparently, his sister-in-law was successful in her amorous offensive, so much so that they are now in the middle of a romance. “She’s so taken with me, that it hardly seems possible,” said Vignale as he caressed his very youthful looking tie, cream-colored, with little blue diamonds, which really shows a notorious evolution from the dark, very wrinkled, brown ties he used to wear when he was just a plain, faithful husband. “Every bit a woman, and with a hunger accumulated over a long time.”
		</p>

		<p>
			I think about robust Elvira’s overdue longing, and I don’t even want to think about what will become of poor Vignale six months from now. But at the moment, happiness radiates through all of his pores. He sincerely believes she was seduced by his masculinity. But he doesn’t realize that as far as Elvira’s “accumulated hunger” is concerned (poor Francisco surely can’t refute his beatific capon face), Vignale merely represented the closest man at hand, an opportunity to bring herself up to date.
		</p>

		<p>
			“And your wife?” I asked him, with an air of vigilant conscientiousness. “Just taking it easy,” Vignale replied. “Do you know what she said to me the other day? That lately I’ve had a much better disposition. And she’s right. Even my liver is working properly.”
