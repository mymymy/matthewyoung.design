		<h3>Saturday, May 18th</h3>

		<p>
			Yesterday, when I finished writing what she had told me, I stopped. I stopped because I wanted the day to end that way, even a day written by me, with that hopeful heartbeat. She didn’t say: “Stop.” But not only did she not say: “Stop,” but said: “That’s why I came to have coffee.” Afterwards she asked me to give her a day, or at least a few hours to think. “I already knew and still it’s a surprise; I have to collect myself.” Tomorrow, Sunday, we’ll have lunch downtown. And now what? Actually, my prepared speech included a long explanation I didn’t even have the opportunity to give. It’s true I wasn’t quite sure that giving a speech was the most advisable thing to do. I had also considered the possibility of offering to counsel her, to place my years of experience at her disposal. However, when I came down from the clouds and saw her in front of me, and started making all those clumsy and uncontrollable gestures, I managed to surmise that the only way of fruitfully escaping ridicule was to say what the inspiration of the moment dictated and nothing else, forgetting the prepared speeches and the previous ambushes. I’m not sorry I followed that impulse. The speech was short and – overall – simple, and I think that simplicity could be an adequate trump card when I face her. She wants to think about it, and that’s fine. But I say to myself: if she already knew I felt the way I do, why didn’t she already have a formed opinion? How can she waver about which attitude to adopt? There could be various explanations, for example: that she actually intended to utter the terrible word “stop,” but had thought it terribly cruel to say it like that, point blank. Another explanation: that she had already known (having already known, in this case, means she had sensed it) what I felt, what I feel, but in spite of that, still hadn’t believed that I would ever express it in words, in a concrete proposition. And therefore, the hesitation. But she said: “that’s why” she came for coffee. What does she mean? Did she want me to pose the question and, therefore, doubt? When one desires to be asked this kind of question, it’s commonly to answer in the affirmative. But she could have also wanted me to finally pose the question so she could stop waiting, tense and uncomfortable, and be prepared, once and for all, to say no and regain her poise. And besides, there’s the boyfriend, the ex-boyfriend. What’s happening with him? Not in regards to the facts (the facts, evidently, indicate the end of that relationship), but in regards to Avellaneda. Am I, finally, the impetus that was missing, the little push her misgivings were waiting for, to convince her to go back to him? Furthermore, there is the difference in our ages, the fact that I’m a widower, my three children, etc., and having to decide what kind of relationship I really want to have with her. This last item is more complicated than it looks. If the reader of this diary were someone other than me I would have to close out this day in the style of serialized novels: “If you want to know the answers to these very pressing questions, read our next installment.”
