		<h3>Wednesday, May 1st</h3>

		<p>
			The dullest International Workers’ Day in world history. To make matters worse, it was a gray, rainy, and prematurely wintry day. There were no people, buses, or anything in the streets. And me in my room, in my single bed, in this dark, heavy silence of seven-thirty. I wish it were nine o’clock in the morning and I were at my desk and every now and then I would look to the left and would find that sad, concentrating, defenseless little figure.
