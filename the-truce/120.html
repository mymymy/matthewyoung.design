		<h3>Saturday, August 17th</h3>

		<p>
			I talked to two members of the Board of Directors this morning. We talked about things of little importance, but nonetheless, the conversation was enough to make me understand that they feel a kind and comprehensive contempt for me. I imagine that when they stretch out in the fluffy chairs in the director’s lounge, they must feel almost omnipotent, or at least as close to Olympus as a sordid and dark soul can get. They’ve reached the top. For a soccer player, the top means to someday play for the national team; for a mystic, to communicate with their God at some point; and for a sentimental person, to find, on some occasion, the true echo of their own emotions in another person. For these poor people on the other hand, the top is getting to sit in the directors’ armchairs, experience the sensation (that for others would be so uncomfortable) that a few destinies are in their hands, create the illusion they make decisions, make arrangements, and that they are Someone. Today, however, when I looked at them. I didn’t see the faces of Someone, but of Something. They look like Things, not People. But, what do I look like to them: An imbecile, an incompetent, the rubbish who dared to turn down an offer from Olympus. Once, a long time ago, I heard one of the oldest members of the board say: “The biggest mistake that some businessmen make is to treat their employees as if they were human beings.” I never forgot, not will I ever forget that phrase, simply because I can’t forgive it. Not only on my own behalf, but also on behalf of all mankind. Now I feel a strong temptation to turn the phrase around and think: “The biggest mistake that some employees make is to treat their bosses as if they were people.” But I resist the temptation. They’re people. They don’t look like it, but they are. And they’re people who are worthy of hateful pity, of the most infamous kind, because the truth is that they develop a shell of pride, a repulsive veneer, and a firm hypocrisy. But deep down, they’re hollow. Filthy and hollow. And they suffer from the most horrible variant of solitude: the solitude of someone who doesn’t even have oneself.
