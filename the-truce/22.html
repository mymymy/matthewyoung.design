		<h3>Friday, March 22nd</h3>

		<p>
			I ran twenty yards to catch the bus and was exhausted. When I sat down I thought I was going to faint. While struggling to take off my jacket, unbutton the collar of my shirt and make myself comfortable in order to breathe easier, I brushed the arm of a woman who was sitting next to me two or three times. Her arm was lukewarm, but not terribly thin. When I brushed her arm I experienced the velvet feel of hair, but didn’t try to find out if it was mine, hers, or both of ours. I unfolded the newspaper and began to read. She, meanwhile, had been reading an Austrian tour brochure. Little by little I started to catch my breath, but still continued to have palpitations for an entire fifteen minutes. Her arm moved two or three times but it didn’t seem to want to move away completely from my own. It would go away and then return again. Sometimes the feel of her arm was limited to a slight sensation of proximity to the tips of the hairs on my arm. I took several surveys of  the street and in the process, discreetly looked her over. She had an angular face, thin lips, long hair, wore little makeup, and had big hands; not very expressive. All of a sudden she dropped her brochure and I bent down to pick it up. Naturally, I glanced at her legs. They weren’t bad looking, with a small Band-Aid on one of her ankles. She didn’t thank me and prepared to get off as the bus approached Sierra Street. She put the brochure away, adjusted her hair, closed her purse, and excused herself to move by me. “I’m getting off, too,” I said, acting on a whim. She started to walk quickly along Pablo de María, but I managed to catch up to her in four long strides. We walked along next to each other for a block and a half. I was still thinking about what I should say to break the ice, when she suddenly turned her head toward me and said: “Make up your mind if you’re going to talk to me or not.”
