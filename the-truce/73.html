		<h3>Friday, May 31st</h3>

		<p>
			May 31st was Isabel’s birthday. How far away she is. I once bought her a German doll for her birthday that walked and moved its eyes. I brought it home in a large and very stiff cardboard box. I placed the box on the bed and asked her to guess what it was. “A doll,” she replied. I never forgave her for that.
		</p>

		<p>
			None of the kids remembered her birthday; or at least they didn’t say anything to me about it. They have gradually moved away from paying homage to their mother. I think Blanca is the only one who really misses her, the only one who mentions her unaffectedly. Could I be to blame? In the beginning, I didn’t talk about Isabel very much only because it was painful. Now I still don’t talk about her much, but it’s because I’m afraid to make a mistake; I’m afraid to talk about another person who would have had nothing to do with my wife.

			Will Avellaneda ever forget about me in this way? Here is where the mystery lies: before beginning to forget, she has to remember, she has to begin to remember.
