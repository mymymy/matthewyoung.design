			Some new confessions from Santini. Once again they were about his little seventeen year old sister. He says that when his parents are out, she comes into his room and dances almost naked in front of him. “She has one of those two-piece bathing suits, you know? Well, when she comes into my room to dance, she removes the top piece,” Santini said. “And what do you do?” I asked. “I...get nervous,” Santini replied. I told him that if the only thing he did was get nervous, then there was no danger. “But, sir, that’s immoral,” Santini said, waving his wrist with the chain and medal. “And her, what reason does she give for dancing in front of you almost naked?” I asked. “Just imagine, sir, she says that I don’t like women and that she’s going to cure me of that,” Santini replied. “And is that true?” I asked. “Well, even if it was true...she has no reason to do what she does...for her own sake...it seems to me,” Santini replied. Then I resigned myself to ask him the question he had been seeking of for a long time: “And what about men, do you like them?” He shook his wrist with the chain and medal and said: “But that’s immoral, sir,” and gave me a wink that was midway between mischievous and lewd and, before I could add anything,  asked: “Or don’t you think so?” I angrily brushed him aside, and gave him one of those really tedious projects to work on. Now he has enough work to last him at least ten days without raising his head. That’s all I needed: a queer in the section. It looks like he is the kind who “has scruples.” What a gem. Nevertheless, one thing is true: there’s more to his sister than meets the eye.
