		<h3>Friday, February 28th</h3>

		<p>
			My last day of work. But I didn’t do anything, of course. I spent the day shaking hands, and receiving embraces. I think the manager was bursting with satisfaction and Muñoz was really touched. My desk remained there. I never thought it would matter so little to me to have to give up my routine. The drawers were now empty. In one of them I found an identification card belonging to Avellaneda. She had left it so we could record the number on her personnel file. I put it in my pocket and here it is. The photograph must be five years old, but she was prettier four months ago. Another matter has become clear, and that is that her mother was wrong: I don’t feel happy about feeling miserable. I simply feel miserable. No more office. Starting tomorrow and to the day I die, time will be at my disposal. After so much waiting, this is leisure. What will I do with it?
