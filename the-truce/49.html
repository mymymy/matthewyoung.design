		<h3>Monday, April 29th</h3>

		<p>
			The section was deserted today. Three people were out. Furthermore, Muñoz was running an errand and Robledo had to review the files in the Sales section. Luckily, there isn’t too much work at this time of the month. The chaos always begins after the first of the month, so I took advantage of the solitude and lack of work to chat with Avellaneda for a while. Over the last few days, I’ve noticed she’s been very quiet, almost sad. Although it is true, her sadness becomes her. It makes her face thin, her eyes sad, and makes her look even younger. I like Avellaneda; I think I’ve already written this down at one time or another. I asked her what was wrong. She approached my desk, smiled (how well she smiles), but didn’t say anything. “Over the last few days I’ve noticed that you’ve been very quiet, almost sad,” I said, and so that my remarks would carry the same weight as my thoughts, I added: “But sadness becomes you.” She didn’t take it as a compliment, but instead, her eyes merely brightened, and she said: “You’re very nice, Mr. Santomé.” My God, why the “Mr. Santomé?” The first part sounded so nice....The “Mr. Santomé” reminded me of being almost fifty, inexorably took me down a peg, and left me with just enough strength to ask in a false, paternal tone: “And your boyfriend?” Poor Avellaneda’s eyes filled with tears, she shook her head in what appeared to be an affirmation, mumbled “sorry,” and then ran into the bathroom. For a while I remain seated in front of my documents not knowing what to do; I think I was moved. I felt agitated, like I haven’t felt in a long time. And it wasn’t the instant nervousness of someone who sees a woman crying, or is about to cry. My agitation was my own, mine only; the agitation of witnessing my own emotional upheaval. All of a sudden it became clear in my head: I’m not dried up! When Avellaneda returned, having already finished crying and a little embarrassed, I was still egotistically enjoying my new discovery. I’m not dried up, I’m not dried up. Then I looked at her with gratitude, and because Muñoz and Robledo were returning at that moment, we both went back to work, as if complying with a secret accord.
