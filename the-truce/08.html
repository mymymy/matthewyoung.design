		<h3>Sunday, February 24th</h3>

		<p>
			It’s hopeless. My encounter with Vignale left me obsessed with the memory of Isabel. It’s no longer about discovering her image through the familiar anecdotes, the photographs, or by some gesture made by Esteban or Blanca. I know all of her characteristics, but I don’t want to know them second hand, but rather remember them directly, see them before me in every detail, just like I see my face in the mirror now. And I don’t find it. I know she had green eyes, but I can’t feel her gaze on me.
