		<h3>Thursday, May 30th</h3>

		<p>
			Esteban’s friend is shifty. He’s charging me fifty percent of my retirement bonus, but assures me I won’t have to work a single day longer than necessary. The temptation is great. Well, it was great, because I’ve already agreed to his terms. He reduced it to forty percent though and recommended I accept this offer before he changed his mind. He said he didn’t do this with anyone; he never charged less than fifty percent. He told me to just ask around, “because there are many abusive and unscrupulous people in my profession,” and he was giving me this special price because I was Esteban’s father. “I love Esteban like a brother,” he said. “We played billiards every night for four years. And that makes one close, sir.” It was then I remembered my conversation with Aníbal on Sunday, the 5th, when I told him: “Now, someone who wants to obtain something licit also offers a bribe. And this means total disorder.”
