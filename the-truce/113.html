		<h3>Thursday, August 1st</h3>

		<p>
			The manager called me into his office. I could never stand that man; he’s so marvelously common and cowardly. On a few occasions I’ve tried to imagine his soul, his abstract self, and I’ve encountered a repulsive image. There, in that place where dignity normally is, he has only a stump; his dignity was amputated. Nevertheless, the orthopedic dignity he now uses is good enough for smiling. And he was doing just that when I entered his office. “I have good news,” he said, and when he rubbed his hands together, he looked like he was going to strangle me. “You’ve been offered nothing less than the Assistant Manager position.” You knew by looking at him that he didn’t agree with the director’s offer. “Allow me to congratulate you,” he said. His hand is sticky, as if he had just opened a jar of marmalade. “Of course, there is one condition,” he continued. For once, the crab exposes itself from underneath the stone. He really does look like a crab. Especially when he walks sideways to get around his desk. “The condition is that you can’t retire for at least two years,” he said. And what about my retirement plans? The Assistant Manager’s position is a fine one, especially for ending one’s career in the firm. There is little to do; you meet with some important clients, supervise personnel, stand in for the manager when he’s absent, tolerate the directors and their horrible jokes, and the directors’ wives and their displays of encyclopedic ignorance. But, what about my retirement plans? “How much time do I have to think it over?” I asked. My question was a preview to my refusal. The Crab’s eyes brightened, and he replied: “One week. I have to give the Board of Directors your answer next Thursday.” When I returned to the department, everyone already knew. That always happens with strictly confidential news. There were hugs, congratulations, and commentary. Even civil servant Avellaneda,  approached and shook my hand.  Of all those hands, hers was the only one which conveyed life.
