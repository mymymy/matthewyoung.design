		<h3>Friday, April 26th</h3>

		<p>
			The manager convened another meeting of section directors. Suárez didn’t attend, fortunately he has a cold. Martínez took advantage of the occasion to tell a few truths. And a good thing, too. I admire his energy. Deep down, I couldn’t care less about the office, the titles, the hierarchies, and other such presumptuousness. I’ve never felt attracted to hierarchies. My secret motto: “The fewer hierarchies there are, the less responsibility there is.” The truth is one lives more comfortably without heavy burdens. As for Martínez, what he does is good. Of all the section directors, the only ones who could aspire to become an Assistant Manager (a position to be filled at the end of the year) would be, in order of seniority: me, Martínez, and Suárez. Martínez isn’t afraid of me because he knows I’m retiring. On the other hand, he’s afraid (and with reason) of Suárez, because since he began sleeping with Miss Valverde, he’s advanced remarkably: from Assistant Cashier to First Officer in the middle of last year, and from First Officer to Director of Shipping about four months ago. Martínez knows perfectly well that the only way to defend himself from Suárez is to discredit him completely. Martínez really doesn’t have to use his imagination too much to realize this since Suárez is, when it comes to job performance, hopeless. He knows himself to be immune,  hated,  but scruples have never been his forte.

			You had to see the manager’s face when Martínez unleashed his concealed and embarrassing anger. Martínez asked him directly if “Mr. Manager knew if any other member of the Board had a daughter available who would like to sleep with section directors,” adding that he was “at your service.” The manager asked him what he meant by that remark, if he wanted to be suspended. “Certainly not,” Martínez replied. “ What I’m interested in is a promotion. I understand that sleeping with a Board Member’s daughter is the procedure.” The manager was pitiful. He knows that Martínez is right, but, furthermore, he knows he can’t do anything about it. For now, at least, Suárez is untouchable.
