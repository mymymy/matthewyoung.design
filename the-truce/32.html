		<h3>Thursday, April 4th</h3>

		<p>
			Today we had to stay late again. This time it was our fault: we had to look for a discrepancy. And there was a big problem in choosing those who would have to stay. Poor Robledo was looking at me defiantly, but I didn’t choose him; I prefer to let him think he has authority over me. Santini had a birthday party to attend, Muñoz has an ingrown toenail that has him in a bad mood, and Sierra hasn’t been to work in two days. In the end, Méndez and Avellaneda stayed. At a quarter to eight, Méndez approached me very mysteriously and asked how much longer we would have to stay. I told him that at least until nine o’clock. Then, acting even more mysterious and taking every possible precaution so that Avellaneda wouldn’t overhear, he told me he had a date at nine o’clock and that first he wanted to go home to shower, shave, change, etc. Still, I made him suffer a little and asked: “Is she pretty?” “She’s beautiful, boss,” he replied. They well know that the only weapon that can conquer me is honesty. And they overdo it. Naturally, I gave him permission to leave.

			Poor Avellaneda. Once we were alone in that enormous office, she became even more nervous than usual. When she handed me a payroll document and I saw that her hand was trembling, I asked her point blank: “Is there something threatening about me? Please don’t be nervous, Avellaneda.” She laughed, and from that moment she worked more calmly. Talking to her is a real problem. I always have to be midway between strictness and trustfulness. I’ve looked at her out of the corner of my eye three or four times and one can see she’s a good woman. She has defined features, loyal. When she becomes a little confused with the work, her hair  inevitably becomes disheveled and she looks good like that. It was ten minutes after nine before we finally found the discrepancy. I asked her if she wanted me to accompany her home. “No, Mr. Santomé, certainly not.” But while we were walking towards the Plaza, we talked about work. She also turned down a cup of coffee. I asked her where she lived and with whom. With her mother and father, she replied. Did she have a boyfriend? Apparently, outside the office I inspire less respect, as she answered affirmatively and in a normal tone of voice. “And when do we take up a collection for your wedding gift?” I asked, as is customary in these situations. “Oh, we’ve only been dating for a year,” she replied. I think that after having told me she had a boyfriend, she felt more secure and began to interpret my questions as being rooted in an almost paternal interest on my part. She summoned all of her courage to inquire whether I was married, had children, etc. She became very serious upon learning that I was a widower and I think she was struggling over whether or not to quickly change the subject or share my sense of loss twenty years later. Common sense prevailed and she went on to talk about her boyfriend. She had just told me he worked for City Hall, when her trolley appeared. She shook my hand and everything; good Lord!
