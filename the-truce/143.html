		<h3>Monday, September 9th</h3>

		<p>
			The staff of the Sales Department has planned a cruel trick to play on someone named Menéndez; a naïve, mysterious, and very superstitious young man who joined the company as part of the group of new employees that included Santini, Sierra, and Avellaneda. It turns out that Menéndez bought a lottery ticket for tomorrow’s drawing. He said that this time he wasn’t going to show the ticket to anyone, because he had the feeling that if he didn’t show it to anyone, the number was going to come up as the big winner. But this afternoon, when the bill collector from the Peñarol Athletic Club came to visit him, Menéndez, upon opening his wallet to pay him, left the ticket on the counter for a few seconds. He didn’t notice, but Rosas, an idiot who is in a permanent state of vigilance, took a mental note of the number on the ticket and immediately gave a verbal accounting of it. The trick the staff has planned for Menéndez tomorrow is the following: in concert with the neighboring  lottery ticket salesman, they’ve arranged for the number, 15.301, to be written down on the blackboard in the first prize column at a pre-determined hour. But only for a few minutes; later he’ll erase it. The salesman liked the notion of the trick so much that, contrary to what the staff expected, he agreed to collaborate.
