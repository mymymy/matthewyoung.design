		<h3>Thursday, May 2nd</h3>

		<p>
			I didn’t want to talk to Avellaneda. First, because I don’t want to scare her; and second, I really don’t know what to say to her. Before I do so, I have to know exactly what’s happening to me. It can’t be that at my age, this young woman, who isn’t very pretty, could suddenly appear and become the center of my attention. I feel like a nervous teenager, this much is true, but when I look at my flabby skin, these wrinkles under my eyes, these varicose veins on my ankles, when I cough like an old man in the morning – which is absolutely necessary in order for my bronchial tubes to begin their work day – then, I no longer feel like a nervous teenager, but simply ridiculous.

			The entire machinery of my emotions came to a halt twenty years ago when Isabel died. First it was pain, then indifference, then much later, freedom, and then finally, tedium. Long, lonely, constant tedium. Oh, I remained sexually active during all these stages, but pick-ups were my technique. Today, an amorous passenger on the bus, tomorrow the accountant who audited us, and the next day, the cashier for Edgardo Lamas, S.A. Never twice with the same woman – a kind of unconscious resistance to commit myself, to pigeonholing the future in a normal and permanent relationship. But what is the point of all this? What was I protecting? Isabel’s image? I don’t think so. I haven’t felt like the victim of that tragic compromise, which I, on the other hand, have never agreed to. My freedom? Could be. My freedom is another name for my inertia. Sleep with one today, another tomorrow; well, this is merely a figure of speech, once a week is enough. Only what nature asks of us and nothing more; just like eating, bathing, and defecating. It was different with Isabel because there was a kind of communion between us and, when we made love, it was as if each of my hardened bones corresponded to a soft hollow in her, and every one of my impulses mathematically found its own receptive echo. We were made for each other. It’s like when you become accustomed to dancing with the same partner. In the beginning, there is a response to every move, and then later, the response corresponds to every thought. Only one of them thinks, but it’s both bodies which cut a figure.
