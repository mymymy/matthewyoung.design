		<h3>Sunday, June 16th</h3>

			However, I told her. We were walking the three blocks from 8th of Octubre to her house, this time without a blackout. I think I was stuttering as I invoked our plan of absolute freedom, of getting to know each other and seeing what happens, of letting time pass, and then reviewing the situation. I’m sure I had stuttered. It was a month ago she appeared at 25th and Misiones to claim that cup of coffee. “I want to propose something,” I said. I’ve been on intimate terms with her since Friday the 7th, but she hasn’t been. I thought she was going to reply: “I know,” which would have been a great relief. But no. She let me carry the entire weight of my proposition. This time she didn’t guess or didn’t want to guess. I’ve never been an expert at preliminaries, so I opted for what was necessary: “I rented an apartment for us.” It was a pity there hadn’t been a blackout just then, because in that case I wouldn’t have seen the look on her face. Perhaps it was a sad look, what do I know? I was never too sure about what women mean when they look at me. Sometimes I think they’re interrogating me, and after a while I realize they were actually responding to me. For a moment, stationed between us, there was a word, like a cloud, like a cloud that began to move. We both thought of the word matrimony, and both understood that the cloud was moving away and that tomorrow the sky would be clear. “Without consulting me?” she asked. I nodded yes. The truth was I had a lump in my throat. “It’s all right,” she said, trying to smile. “This is how I have to be treated, through prepared scenarios.” We were standing in the entrance hall. The door was open because it was much earlier than the other day. There were lights here and there. There was no room for mystery, only that other thing called silence. I began to realize my proposition wasn’t a complete success. But at age fifty, one can no longer aspire to complete successes. And what if she had said no? I was paying a price for that absence of a negative, and that price was the uncomfortable situation; the unpleasant, almost grievous moment when I see her, silent, in front of me, somewhat bent in her dark jacket, her expression saying good-bye to various things. She didn’t kiss me, nor did I take the initiative. Her face was tense, hard. All of a sudden, without prior warning, it was as if all of her reflexes slackened, as if she had renounced an unbearable mask, and like that, looking upwards, with her head leaning against the door, she began to cry. And they weren’t the so-called famous tears of happiness. It was that weeping which occurs when one feels opaquely miserable. But when someone feels brilliantly miserable, then yes it’s worth crying, with the accompanying trembling, and shaking, especially in front of an audience. But when, in addition to feeling miserable, one feels gloomy, when there is no room for rebellion, sacrifice, or heroism, then one has to cry silently, because no one can help and because one is aware such things happen and that in the end, one retains one’s balance and normalcy. That’s what her crying was like. No one can fool me when it comes to this topic. “Can I help you?” I asked, even so, “can I remedy this somehow?” Foolish questions. Still, I asked another one, from the very bottom of my misgivings: “What’s wrong? Do you want us to get married?” But the cloud was now far away. “No,” she replied. “I’m crying because it’s a pity.” And it’s so true. Everything is a pity: that there hadn’t been a blackout, that I’m fifty years old, that she’s a good woman, my three children, her old boyfriend, the apartment...I took out my handkerchief and dried her eyes. “Is it all over now?” I asked. “Yes, it’s all over now,” she replied. It was a lie, but we both understood that she did well in lying. With a still convalescing look, she added: “Don’t think I’m always so foolish.” Don’t think, she said; I’m sure she said don’t think. She had been intimate with me just then.
