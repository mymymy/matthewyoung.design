		<h3>Wednesday, July 17th</h3>

		<p>
			Blanca was sad today. Jaime, her and I ate dinner in silence. Esteban was on his first night out since his illness. I didn’t say anything during dinner, because I know quite well how Jaime reacts. Afterwards, when he had left, virtually without saying good-bye (the grumbling which preceded the door slam can’t be interpreted as “good night”), I remained in the dining room reading the newspaper while Blanca purposely lingered clearing the table. I had to lift up the newspaper so she could put away the table cloth, and then I looked at her. Her eyes were a bit tearful. “What’s wrong with Jaime?” I asked. “I had an argument with him, and Diego, too,” she replied. Very puzzling. I couldn’t imagine Jaime and Diego joining forces against her. “Diego says Jaime is a queer. And that’s why we argued,” she continued. The word hit me twice: first, because it was directed at my son, and second, because it was Diego who had made the remark; Diego, who I trust and place my hopes in. “And can you tell me why your blessed Diego thinks he can be insulting in this way?” I asked. Blanca smiled with some bitterness and replied: “But that’s the worse thing. It’s not an insult. It’s the truth. And that’s why I argued with Jaime.” It was obvious that Blanca was forcing herself to say all of that, especially because it was I who was the recipient of her revelation. It even sounded insincere to me when I said: “And do you give more credit to Diego’s slander than to what your own brother says?” Blanca lowered her eyes. She was holding the bread basket. It was the very image of poignancy, a moving and homely poignancy. “As a matter of fact,” she said, “it’s Jaime himself who says it.” Until that moment I never thought my eyes could pop open so wide. My temples hurt. “So, those friends of his...,” I stammered. “Yes,” she said. It was a hammering blow. Still, at that moment, I realized that deep down I had suspected it. And that’s the reason, the only reason why the word didn’t sound altogether new to me. “There’s just one thing I ask,” she added, “don’t say anything to him. He’s lost and has no sense of scruples, you know? He says he’s not attracted to women, that it’s not something he searched for, that each person has a God-given nature, and that he wasn’t given the capacity to feel attracted to women. He justifies himself arduously and I assure you he doesn’t have a guilt complex.” And then, without any conviction, I said: “If I smash his head in with a few punches, you’ll see how fast he gets a guilt complex.” Blanca laughed for the first time all evening and said: “Don’t disappoint me. I know you’re not going to do any such thing.” Then I became discouraged, horribly discouraged and hopeless. This was Jaime, my son, who inherited Isabel’s forehead and mouth.

			How much of this is my fault and how much of it is his? It’s true I didn’t take care of them the way I should have, that I couldn’t totally replace their mother. Ah, but I don’t have a mother’s calling. I’m not even too sure about my calling as a father. But what does this have to do with how he turned out? Perhaps I would have been able to cut off those friendships when they first began. Perhaps if I had done that, he would have continued seeing them without my knowledge. “I have to talk to him,” I said, as Blanca appeared to be resigning herself to the turmoil. “And also, you have to reconcile with Diego,” I added.
