		<h3>Monday, February 25th</h3>

		<p>
			I don’t see my children very often. Our schedules don’t always coincide and our plans and interests even less. They are polite to me, but because they are tremendously reserved, their politeness always appears to merely be the fulfillment of a duty. Esteban, for example, is always compromising in order to avoid discussing my opinions. Could it simply be the generation gap that separates us? Or could I do more to try to reach them? Generally, I view them as being more unbelieving than they are foolish, and more engrossed in thought than I was at their age.

			This evening we had dinner together. It had probably been two months since we all had a meal together as a family. I jokingly asked what we were celebrating, but there was no reply. Blanca looked at me and smiled, as if to inform me she understood my good intentions and nothing more. I then began to listen to the scarce interruptions of the sacred silence. Jaime said the soup was tasteless. “The salt is four inches away from your right hand,” replied Blanca, and scathingly added: “Would you like me to pass it to you?” The soup was tasteless. It’s true, but what difference did it make? Esteban reported that starting in six months our rent would be raised by eighty pesos. Since we all contribute, the situation isn’t too serious. Jaime began to read the newspaper. I think it’s rude when people read the newspaper when they are dining with their family, and I told him so. Jaime stopped reading the newspaper, but it was as if he hadn’t, because he continued being sullen and angry. I related my encounter with Vignale, trying to make light of it in an attempt to introduce a little levity to our meal. But Jaime asked: “Which Vignale is it?” “Mario Vignale,” I replied. “Is he partly bald and has a moustache?” “The same,” I replied. “I know him,” said Jaime. “He’s a piece of work, a friend of Ferreira’s. Well-known for accepting bribes.” Deep down I’m glad that Vignale is a worthless piece of filth, and therefore have no qualms about brushing him off. Then Blanca asked: “So, did he remember mom?” I thought Jaime was going to say something, that he had moved his lips, but he decided to remain quiet. “Lucky him,” Blanca added. “I don’t.” “I do,” said Esteban. How does he remember? Is it like me, with memories of memories, or directly, like someone who sees their own face in the mirror? Is it possible that Esteban, who was only four years old at the time, can possess her image, and that I, on the other hand, who has logged so many, many, many nights, am left with nothing? We would make love in the dark. Perhaps that’s the reason. I’m sure that’s the reason. I have a tangible memory of those nights, and it’s indeed direct. But what about the daytime? During the day we weren’t in the dark. I would arrive home tired, full of problems, perhaps even furious with the injustice of that week, that month.

			Sometimes we went over our bills, but there was never enough to pay them. Perhaps we spent too much time looking at numbers, the additions, or the subtractions  and didn’t have time to look at ourselves. Wherever she is, if she’s there, what memory could she have of me? After all, does memory matter? “Sometimes I feel sad, over nothing more than not knowing what I’m missing,” murmured Blanca, while she served the peaches in syrup. We each got three and a half.
