		<h3>Thursday, July 4th</h3>

		<p>
			I spoke to Aníbal for a long time. It’s the first time I mentioned Avellaneda’s name to someone, that is to say, the first time I mentioned her name with the sincere feelings I have for it. At some moment, while I was telling him, it looked as if he was observing the situation from the outside, like a profoundly interested spectator. Aníbal listened to me with religious attention. “And why don’t you get married?” he asked. “I don’t quite understand the meaning of your hesitation.” It was hard to believe he wouldn’t understand, it was so clear. I went back to the explanation, the stereotypical explanation I’ve been giving myself since the beginning: my age, her age, me in ten years, her in ten years, my desire not to hurt her, the other desire not to look ridiculous, the enjoyment of the present, my three children, etc., etc. “And you think this way you’re not hurting her?” he asked. “Of course, that’s inevitable, but in any case, I’m hurting her less than I would be by shackling her,” I replied. “And what does she say? Does she agree?” he continued. That’s called an awkward question. I don’t know if she agrees. When she had the chance, she said yes, but the truth is I don’t now whether she agrees or not. Could it be she prefers a stable situation, officially stable and sacred? Could I be telling myself I do it for her, but in reality be doing it for myself? “Are you afraid of looking ridiculous, or is it something else?” he asked. Apparently, the guy was determined to put his finger on the sore spot. “What do you mean by that?” I said. “You asked me to be candid didn’t you?” he replied. “I mean, the entire problem seems clear to me: you’re afraid that in ten years she’s going to be unfaithful to you.” How ugly it is to be told the truth, especially if it’s one of those truths one has avoided telling oneself even during the morning soliloquies, when one is just waking and mumbling bitter nonsense, profoundly nasty, full of self-rancor, which is necessary to dispel before completely waking up and putting on the mask that, for the rest of the day, others will see, and that will see others. So, I’m afraid that in ten years she’ll be unfaithful to me? I answered Aníbal with a curse word, which is the traditional manly reaction to being treated like a cuckold, even if it is from a long distance and postdated. But the doubt continued to spin around in my head and at the moment I write this I can’t avoid feeling a little less generous, a little less poised, and a little more vulgar and surly.
