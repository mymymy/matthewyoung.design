		<h3>Friday, August 30th</h3>

		<p>
			During my vacation, I wrote every day. Now it’s an uphill battle to return to the office. This vacation has been a good appetizer before my retirement, though. Today, Blanca received a spiteful, violent letter from Jaime. The paragraph he directs at me says the following: “Tell Dad that all of my love affairs were platonic, so that when he has nightmares in which my filthy person appears, he can turn over and breathe easy. For now.” There’s too much hatred together in one place for it to be true. In the end I’m going to think that this son loves me a little bit.
