		<h3>Tuesday, May 7th</h3>

		<p>
			There are two ways I can approach Avellaneda: a) candidly, essentially telling her: “I like you, let’s see what happens; or b) dishonestly, essentially telling her: “Look here, girl, I’m experienced, I could be your father, take my advice.” Although it seems incredible, perhaps the second option would be the best choice for me. With the first option I risk quite a bit, and besides, everything is still very new. I think that up to now she sees me as a boss who is generally kind and nothing else. Nevertheless, she’s not a child. She’s twenty-four, not fourteen. She’s the kind middle-aged men prefer. But her boyfriend was a teenager, nevertheless. Well, look at what that got her. Perhaps now, in response, she’ll go to the other extreme. And I could be that other extreme; a middle-aged gentleman, experienced, gray-haired, rested, 49 years old, without any major aches, and earning a good salary. I don’t include my three children in my dossier; they don’t help. Anyway, she knows about them.

			However (and to put it in terms of neighborhood gossip), what are my intentions? The truth is I’m not thinking about anything permanent, like “until death do us part” (I wrote “death” and Isabel quickly appeared, but Isabel was something else, in regards to Avellaneda, I think the sexual aspect is less important to me, or that is to say, that perhaps sex is less important at forty-nine than it is at twenty-eight), but I haven’t decided to be without Avellaneda either. I already know that the ideal situation would be to have Avellaneda without any obligation to permanency. But that would be too much to ask. Nevertheless, one could try.

			I can’t know anything until I talk to her. They’re all stories I tell myself. It’s true that, at this late stage, I’m a little bored with rendezvous in the dark and hotel encounters. There’s always a tense atmosphere and a sense of immediacy, of something urgent which distorts any kind of dialogue I could have with any type of woman. Up until the moment I go to bed with her, regardless of whom she is, the important thing is to go to bed with her; and after making love, the important things is to leave, each of us to our own bed, and ignore each other forever. Throughout the many, many years of playing this game, I don’t remember a single comforting conversation, or touching remark (mine or theirs) of the kind that are destined to reappear later, at who knows what awkward moment, to put an end to some hesitation so that we can decide to adopt a stance that requires a minimum dose of courage. Well, this isn’t entirely true. Six or seven years ago, in a hotel on Rivera Street, a woman told me this famous phrase: “You make love with the look of a clerk.”
