		<h3>Tuesday, August 27th</h3>

		<p>
			Cold and sunny. Winter sun, which is the most affectionate, the most benevolent. I went to the Matriz Plaza, found a bench, spread a newspaper over the bird droppings, and sat down. In front of me a city worker was raking the lawn. He did it very slowly, as if it was a function that was above all impulses. How would I feel if I were a city worker raking the lawn? No, that’s not my calling. If I could choose a profession other than the one I have, a routine other than the one that has worn me out for the last thirty years, than I would choose to be a waiter in a café. And I would be an active waiter with a great memory, an exemplary waiter. I would use mental tricks so that I wouldn’t forget anyone’s order. It must be wonderful to always work with new faces, to talk freely with a man who walks into the café today, asks for a cup of coffee, and never comes around here again. The people are terrific, entertaining, and energetic. It must be great to work with people instead of numbers, books, and payroll accounts. Even if I were to travel, even if I were to leave here and have the opportunity to be amazed with landscapes, monuments, roads, and works of art, nothing would fascinate me as much as the People, to see the People pass by and scrutinize their faces, to recognize, here and there, signs of happiness and bitterness, see how they rush headlong towards their destinies, in insatiated turbulence, with splendid haste, and see how they move along, unaware of their brevity, their insignificance, their life without  reservations, without ever feeling cornered, without ever admitting they are cornered. Until now, I don’t think I’ve ever been aware of the presence of Matriz Plaza. I must have crossed it a thousand times, and perhaps on many occasions I even cursed all the detours one has to make to circle the fountain. I’ve seen it before, of course I’ve seen it, but I had never stopped to observe it, to hear it, to draw out its character and examine it. I spent a good while contemplating the aggressively solid soul of the Cabildo, the hypocritically scrubbed face of the Cathedral, and the discouraged swaying of the trees. I think at that moment one of my convictions was definitely affirmed: I am from this place, this city. In this (and probably in nothing else) I think I’m a fatalist. Each one of us IS from only one place on earth and it’s there that one should pay one’s dues. I am from here. I pay my dues here. That man passing by (the one with the long overcoat, the protruding ear, the violent limp), he is my fellow man. He still ignores that I exist, but one day he’ll see me from the front, from the side or from the rear, and he’ll have the feeling there’s something secret between us, a hidden bond that unites us, that gives us the strength to understand each other. Or perhaps that day will never arrive, perhaps he’ll never notice this plaza, this air that makes us fellow men, pairs us off, communicates us. But it doesn’t matter; at any rate, he’s my fellow man.
