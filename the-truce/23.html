		<h3>Sunday, March 24th</h3>

		<p>
			After giving it some serious thought, Friday was quite a strange experience. We didn’t mention our names, exchange phone numbers, or discuss anything personal. But still, I could swear that sex is unimportant to this woman. Instead, she seemed exasperated about something, as if her surrender to me was some strange form of revenge she was taking against I don’t know what. I must confess that this was the first time I have ever seduced a woman with just my elbow, and also the first time that, once in the motel room, I’ve ever seen a woman undress so quickly, and in broad daylight. What did the aggressive nonchalance with which she lay down on the bed prove? She was trying so hard to show that she was completely naked that I was starting to believe that it was the first time she had ever been naked in front of a man. But no, she wasn’t new at this. And with her serious face, her mouth without lipstick, her expressionless hands, she still managed to enjoy herself. Later, at what she felt was the opportune moment, she begged me to talk dirty to her. It’s not my specialty, but I think I satisfied her.
