		<h3>Friday, July 26th</h3>

		<p>
			Eight o’clock in the morning. I’m eating breakfast at the Tupí Nambá Café. It’s one of my greatest pleasures. Sitting next to one of the windows that face Plaza Libertad, is even better. It’s raining. I’ve learned to love that hideous symbol of folklore that is the Palacio Salvo Tower. No wonder it’s on all the postcards the tourists buy. It’s almost a representation of the national character: impudent, dull, over-burdened, and charming. It’s so, so ugly that it puts one in a good mood. I like the Tupí at this hour, very early, when it still hasn’t been invaded by the queers (I had forgotten about Jaime, what a nightmare) and there’s only a few other lonely old men around, they’re reading the El Día or El Debate newspapers with incredible delight. The majority of the customers are retirees who haven’t been able to stop waking up very early. Will I continue to patronize the Tupí when I retire? Will I never get accustomed to enjoying staying in bed until eleven, like some executive’s son? The true separation of the social classes should have been made taking into account the time each person gets out of bed. Biancamano, the amnesic, efficiently candid, and cheerful waiter, approaches my table. For the fifth time, I ask him for a cortado* and croissants. Instead, he brings me a large cup of coffee and crackers with ham and cheese. He’s trying so hard, so I just give up. While I drop the sugar cubes into the cup, he talks to me about work and weather, saying: “This rain is a nuisance to people, but I say to them: ‘After all, it is winter isn’t it?’” I say that he’s right, because it’s obvious that it’s winter. Then, a man sitting at a table in the back calls over to him; he’s very upset because Biancamano brought him something he hadn’t ordered. Now he’s the kind of person who doesn’t give up. Or perhaps he’s just an Argentine who came to pay his weekly visit to exchange currency and still doesn’t know the house routine. The newspapers are the second part of my breakfast. There are days when I buy all of them because I like to read all of their regular articles. The inconsistent style of syntax and the editorials of El Debate; the civilized hypocrisy of El País; the crude reporting of El Día, barely cut short by a few anticlerical faces; and the sturdy organization of La Mañana, ambitious like none other. How different and yet how similar they all are. They all play a kind of card game; tricking one another, exchanging face signals, and switching partners. But they all play with the same deck of cards and feed on the same lie. And we read, and because we read, we believe, vote, discuss, and we generously and foolishly forget that what they’re saying today is contrary to what they said yesterday; that today they passionately defend the same person they cursed yesterday, and that worst of all, today that same person proudly and happily accepts that defense. That’s why I prefer the frightening openness of the Palacio Salvo Tower, because it was always dreadful and it never misled us, because it was built here, in the most frequented spot in the city, and for the last thirty years has forced all of us, citizens and foreigners alike, to raise our eyes in homage to its ugliness. But in order to read the newspapers, one has to lower one’s eyes.
