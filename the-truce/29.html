		<h3>Sunday, March 31st</h3>

		<p>
			This afternoon, as I was coming out of the California movie theatre, I saw the woman from the bus, the “elbow woman,” from a distance. She was walking with a heavily built man, athletic, but not very bright. When the man laughed, it was as if he was reflecting the unexpected variants of human imbecility. She, too, would laugh, throwing her head back and pressing herself against him affectionately. They passed in front of me and although she saw me in the middle of a burst of laughter, she didn’t interrupt it. I couldn’t be sure that she had recognized me. In the meantime, though, she said to the center forward: “Oh, darling,” and with a flirtatious and muscular move placed her head against his giraffe designed tie. Afterwards, they turned on Ejido Street. And now a big question: What does this woman have to do with the one who got undressed in record time the other afternoon?
