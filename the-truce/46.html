		<h3>Wednesday, April 24th</h3>

		<p>
			Today, like every April 24th, we had dinner together. There is a good reason: Esteban’s birthday. I think we all feel a bit forced to show our happiness. Esteban didn’t even seem excited; he told a few jokes, and stoically endured our embraces.
		</p>

			The meal Blanca prepared was the high point of the evening. This naturally predisposes one to being in a good mood. It isn’t completely absurd that Chicken à la Portugaise would make me feel more optimistic than a potato omelet. Hasn’t it occurred to any sociologist to conduct a thorough analysis of the influence of digestion on Uruguayan culture, economy, and politics? My God, how we eat! In happiness, pain, fear, and discouragement. Our sensibility is primordially digestive. Our innate democratic calling is based on an old assumption: “We all need to eat.” Our disciples care only partly, that God will forgive their doubts, but in turn get down on their knees with tears in their eyes, and pray they will not go without their daily bread. And that Daily Bread isn’t — I’m sure — a mere symbol: it’s a two-pound German loaf.

			Well, we ate well, drank a good claret, and celebrated with Esteban. After dinner, while we were slowly stirring our coffee, Blanca made a sudden announcement: she has a boyfriend. Jaime covered her in a strange, undefined look (What is Jaime? Who is Jaime? What does Jaime want?). Esteban happily asked the name of the “unfortunate guy.” I think I felt happy for her and made it obvious. “And when are we going to meet this lovely man?” I asked. “Look, Dad, Diego isn’t going to make those customary Monday, Wednesday and Friday visits. We meet anywhere; downtown, at his house, or here.” When she said “at his house” we all must have frowned, because she quickly added: “He lives with his mother in an apartment. Don’t be afraid.” “And does his mother ever go out?” Esteban asked, by now a bit disagreeable. “Don’t be annoying,” said Blanca and quickly threw a question at me: “Dad, I want to know if you trust me. Yours is the only opinion I care about. Do you trust me?” When I’m asked in this way, point-blank, there is only one answer I can give. And my daughter knows it. “Of course, I trust you,” I replied. Esteban limited himself to leaving his skepticism on the record by clearing his throat loudly. Jaime remained silent.
