		<h3>Wednesday, March 27th</h3>

		<p>
			Today I stayed at the office until eleven p.m. A big favor on the manager’s behalf, sure. He called me at six-fifteen to tell me he needed that worthless material first thing in the morning. It was a job for three people, so Avellaneda, poor woman, offered to stay and help. But I felt sorry for her.
		</p>

		<p>
			Three fellows in the Shipping Department also stayed late. Actually, they were the only ones who really needed to stay, but then of course, the manager certainly wasn’t going to force Ms. Valverde’s lover to stay late without embellishing the punishment by giving some innocent person extra work to do. This time I was the innocent person. Patience. I’m hoping that Valverde will get bored with that gigolo.
		</p>

			Working late depresses me terribly. The entire office is quiet, deserted, with filthy desks covered with file folders and filing cabinets. There is an overall appearance of garbage, of waste. And in the middle of that silence and darkness, there are three fellows here and three fellows there, working unwillingly, dragging along the tiredness of their previous eight hours.

			Robledo and Santini would dictate the figures to me while I recorded them using a typewriter. At eight p.m. my back started to hurt; near my left shoulder. At nine o’clock I didn’t mind the pain and kept typing the dull figures. No one spoke when we had finished. The three fellows in the Shipping Department had already left. The three of us who were left, went to Plaza Independencia, and I bought them a cup of coffee at the counter of the Sorocabana, and then we said good-bye. I think they were holding a grudge against me because I had selected them to work late.
