		<h3>Monday, March 18th</h3>

		<p>
			Last night Esteban arrived home at twelve, Jaime at twelve-thirty, and Blanca at one o’clock. I heard all of them come in, picking up every minute sound, every footstep, every mumbled curse word. I think Jaime was a little drunk, because I heard him bumping into furniture and he kept the bathroom faucet running for about a half an hour. However, it was Esteban who was cursing, and he never drinks. When Blanca arrived, Esteban said something to her from his room and she responded by telling him to mind his own business. Then there was silence, three hours of silence. On the weekends I’m plagued by insomnia. And I wonder, will I ever be able to sleep when I retire?

			Blanca was the only one I spoke to this morning and I told her I didn’t like her coming home late. She isn’t disrespectful, so she didn’t deserve to be scolded. But in any case, it’s a mother and father’s duty. I should be both at the same time, but I think I’m neither. I felt I went too far when I heard myself ask in a monitoring tone of voice: “What were you doing last night? Where did you go?” Then, while she spread butter on her toast, she replied: “Why do you feel obligated to be the bad guy? There are two things we can both be sure of: that we love each other and that I’m not doing anything improper.” I felt defeated, but nevertheless added, if for no other reason than to save face: “It all depends on what you consider improper.”
