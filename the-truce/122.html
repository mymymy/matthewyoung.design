		<h3>Monday, August 19th</h3>

		<p>
			Today I started my last leave before retiring. It rained all day, so I spent the entire afternoon in the apartment. I changed two outlets, painted a little cabinet, and washed two nylon shirts. Avellaneda arrived at seven-thirty, but only stayed until eight o’clock. She had to go to an aunt’s birthday. She says that Muñoz, as my substitute, is unbearably bossy and pedantic. There’s already been an incident involving Robledo.
