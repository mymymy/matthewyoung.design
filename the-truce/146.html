		<h3>Thursday, September 12th</h3>

		<p>
			Diego is a worrier, and thanks to his influence, Blanca is becoming a worrier, too. Tonight I spoke with both of them for a long time. They’re worried about their country, their generation, and, at the base of both abstractions, their worry is called “Themselves.” Diego would like to do something rebellious, positive, stimulating, renovating; but he’s not too sure what. Until now, what he feels most intensely is an aggressive nonconformism, in which there is still a lack of some coherence. He thinks the apathy of our people, their lack of social drive, their democratic tolerance towards fraud, and their pedestrian and innocuous reaction towards mystification is fatal. For example, he thinks it’s frightening that there is a morning newspaper which employs seventeen editorial writers who write as a hobby, seventeen landlords who protest against the horrible plague of the holidays from a bungalow in Punta del Este, seventeen dandies who use all of their intelligence and lucidity to cram skillful conviction into an issue they don’t believe in; a diatribe that they, deep down, consider unjust. He is incited to rebel seeing the leftists endure, without too much pretense, a backdrop of gentrified comfort, rigid ideals, and moderate hypocrisy. “Do you see any way out?” he asks and then asks again, with candid, provocative anxiousness. “As far as I’m concerned, I don’t. There are people who understand what’s happening, who think it’s absurd, but who limit themselves to complaining about it. There’s a lack of passion, that’s the secret of this great democratic bubble we’ve turned into. For a number of years we’ve been calm, objective; but objectivity is harmless, it’s of no use in changing the world, or even a pocket-sized country like this one. There’s a need for passion; a shouted passion, or mentally shouted, or written in shouts. One has to shot in people’s ears, since their apparent deafness is a type of self-defense, a cowardly and unhealthy self-defense. We had to wake in others the shame in themselves to substitute their self-defense for self-disgust. On the day the Uruguayan feels disgusted about his own passivity, he will become useful.
