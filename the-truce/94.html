		<h3>Wednesday, July 3rd</h3>

		<p>
			It’s hard to believe, but I hadn’t seen Aníbal since he returned from Brazil, at the beginning of May. I was glad he called yesterday. I needed to talk to someone, confide in someone. Only then did I realize that up to now I had kept my entire relationship with Avellaneda to myself, that I hadn’t told anyone. And it makes sense. Who could I have discussed it with? My children? I get goose bumps just thinking about it. Vignale? I think about his mischievous wink, his pat on my shoulder, his abetting laugh, and I immediately become unwaveringly reserved. My co-workers? It would be a horrible misstep, and at the same time, make it an absolute certainty that Avellaneda would have to quit her job. But even if she didn’t work at the office, I don’t think I would have the strength to talk about myself that way. There are no friendships in the workplace; there are fellows who see each other everyday, complain together or apart, tell jokes and laugh, exchange gripes and convey their grudges, mumble about the Directorate in general, and flatter every director in private. This is called coexistence, but only through a mirage can coexistence manage to look like friendship. After so many years in an office, I confess that Avellaneda is my first true object of affection. The rest have the disadvantage of the unchosen relationship, of the bond imposed by the circumstances. After all, what do I have in common with Muñoz, Méndez, and Robledo? Still, we laugh together sometimes, have a drink occasionally, and are pleasant to each other. Deep down though, they’re strangers to each other, because in this type of superficial relationship one talks about many things, but never about the essentials, the truly important and decisive things. I think work is what impedes another kind of trust; work, that kind of constant hammering, morphine, or toxic gas. On occasion, one of them (Muñoz particularly) has approached me to initiate an actual conversation. He begins to talk, candidly outlining his self-portrait, and synthesizing the parts of his drama, that moderate, stationary, baffling drama which poisons everyone’s life, regardless of how average one feels. But there is always someone who beckons from the counter. For a half an hour Muñoz has to explain the inconvenience and the levy imposed for late payment to a delinquent client; argues, shouts a bit, and surely feels degraded. When he returns to my desk, he looks at me and doesn’t say anything. He makes a strong effort to smile, but the corners of his mouth fold downward. Then he takes an old payroll document in his hands, carefully crumples it, and throws it in the waste basket. It’s a simple substitute; that which is no longer useful, what he throws in the waste basket, is trust. Yes, work muzzles trust. But there’s also derision. We’re all derision specialists. The availability of interest toward our neighbor has to be utilized in some way, otherwise, it becomes cystic and then claustrophobia and neurasthenia, what do I know, suddenly ensues. Since we don’t have enough courage or honesty to interest ourselves amicably in our neighbor (not the nebulous, biblical, faceless neighbor, but the neighbor with a first and last name, the nearest neighbor, the one who writes at the desk in front of mine and hands me the calculation of the profit gains so I can review and initial it), since we voluntarily renounce friendship, well then, let’s derisively interest ourselves in that neighbor who is always vulnerable for eight hours. Furthermore, derision provides a kind of solidarity. Today this is the candidate, tomorrow that one, and the day after it will be me. The one who is mocked curses silently, but quickly becomes resigned, knows it’s only part of the game, and that in the near future, perhaps in an hour or two, he can choose the form of revenge which best coincides with his vocation. The mockers, for their part, feel united, enthusiastic, and effervescent. Every time one of them adds an incisive element to their derision, the others celebrate, nod at each other, and feel lustful with complicity; all that’s left is to embrace each other and shout hurrah. And what relief it is to laugh, even when one has to hold back laughter because the manager has appeared in the back, showing his watermelon face, and what retaliation against the routine, the paperwork, that sentence which means being ensnared in something unimportant for eight hours, something which inflates the bank accounts of those useless people who sin by the mere fact of being alive, of allowing themselves to live, of the inane who believe in God only because they don’t know God stopped believing in them a long time ago. Derision and work. After all, how are they different? And how much work derision is, how tiring! And what a mockery this job is, what a bad joke!
