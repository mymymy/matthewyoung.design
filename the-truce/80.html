		<h3>Friday, June 14th</h3>

		<p>
			It must be about a month since I last had more than a five minute conversation with Jaime or Esteban. They come home grumbling, lock themselves in their rooms, eat in silence while reading the newspaper, they leave cursing, and then return at dawn. Blanca, on the other hand, is kind, talkative, and happy. I don’t see Diego very often, but I recognize his presence in Blanca’s face. Indeed, I’m not mistaken: he’s a good man. I know that Esteban has a second job. Someone at the club found it for him. I have the impression, nevertheless, that he’s starting to regret letting himself become completely ensnared. Someday he’ll lose his temper, I can see it already, and he’ll tell everyone to go to hell. I hope it’s soon. I don’t like to see him involved in an enterprise that apparently contradicts his old convictions. I don’t like it that he becomes cynical, one of those fake cynics who, when the time for reproaching arrives, excuses himself, saying: “It’s the only way to make progress, to be someone.” Jaime, on the other hand, does work, and is good at his job. Also, they love him there. But Jaime’s problem is something else, and what’s worse is that I don’t know what it is. He’s always nervous and unsatisfied. Apparently, he has character, but sometimes I’m not too sure whether it’s character or a passing fancy. I don’t like his friends, either. There’s something posh about them. They’re from the upper class Pocitos area and perhaps deep down in their hearts they look down him. They take advantage of Jaime because he’s clever, clever with his hands, and he’s always doing something they’ve entrusted to him. And free, too, as it should be. None of them work; they’re all papa’s boys. Sometimes I hear them complaining: “Hey, too bad you’ve got to work. We can’t count on you.” They say “job” like someone who is performing a heroic deed, like a Salvationist who approaches a drunken beggar and, transfixed with disgust and pity, touches him with the tip of his shoe; they say “job” as if after having said it, they would have to disinfect themselves.
