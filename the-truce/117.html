		<h3>Monday, August 12th</h3>

		<p>
			Yesterday afternoon we were sitting together at the table. We weren’t doing anything, not even talking. My hand was resting on an empty ashtray. We were sad: that’s what we were, sad. But it was a sweet sadness, almost like a peacefulness. She was looking at me when she suddenly moved her lips to say three words. She said: “I love you.” Then I realized it was the first time she was saying that to me, and furthermore; it was the first time she was saying it to anyone. Isabel would have repeated it to me twenty times a night. For Isabel, repeating those words was like giving me another kiss; it was a simple aspect of the love game. Avellaneda, on the other hand, had said it once, the one necessary time. Perhaps she doesn’t need to say it anymore, because it’s not a game: it’s an essence. And then I felt a  tremendous pressure on my chest, a pressure which didn’t seem to affect any physical organ, but that was almost asphyxiating, unbearable. There, in the chest, near the throat, is where the soul must be, curled up. “I hadn’t said it to you until now,” Avellaneda mumbled, “but not because I didn’t love you, but because I didn’t know why I loved you. Now I know why.” I could breathe now, and it seemed the wave of hot air I was feeling was coming from my stomach. I can always breathe when someone explains matters. Pleasure in the face of the mysterious and enjoyment in the face of the unexpected are sensations which my moderate powers can’t tolerate sometimes. Fortunately, someone always explains matters. “Now I know,” said Avellaneda. “I don’t love you for your face, for your years, for your words, or for your intentions. I love you because you’re made of good stock.” No one had ever held such a moving, simple, and life-giving opinion of me. I want to believe that it’s true; I want to believe that I’m made of good stock. Perhaps that moment had been exceptional, but still, I felt alive. That pressure on my chest means being alive.
