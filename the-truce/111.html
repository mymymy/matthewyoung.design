		<h3>Saturday, July 27th</h3>

			She’s delighted with Blanca. “I never imagined you could have such a charming daughter,” she said. She repeats this every half hour or so. This remark and Blanca’s (“I never thought you had such good taste”) don’t speak kindly of me, of the retroactive trust they were investing in my respective capability to generate and to choose. But I’m happy. And so is Avellaneda. Her scribbled “Thanks” of last Tuesday was fully developed afterwards. She confesses to having had a bad moment when she first met my daughter. She thought Blanca had come to cause a scene, expressing every form of reproach she imagined as justifiable, that she felt she was about to receive. She thought the shock was going to be so violent, so serious, so crushing, that our relationship wasn’t going to survive. And only then did she fully realize that our relationship really mattered in her life, that perhaps now it would be unbearable to end this relationship which barely has a temporary patent. “You won’t believe it, but all of that crossed my mind while your daughter was approaching us between the other tables,” she said. That’s why Blanca’s friendly attitude was an unexpected pleasure. “Tell me, could I be her friend?” is now her hopeful question, and she assumes a delightful look on her face, perhaps the same look she had twenty years ago when she asked her parents about the Three Wise Men.
