		<h3>Tuesday, April 2nd</h3>

		<p>
			I don’t see my children very often. Especially Jaime. It’s curious, because it’s precisely Jaime who I would like to see more often. Of the three of them, he’s the only one with a sense of humor. I don’t know how valid affection is in the relationship between fathers and sons, but the truth is that of the three of them, Jaime is the nicest. But, as compensation, he is also the least transparent.
		</p>

		<p>
			I saw him today, but he didn’t see me. It was an interesting experience. I was at Convención and Colonia saying good-bye to Muñoz who had accompanied me that far. I saw him walk by on the sidewalk in front of me with two others who had something disagreeable in their demeanor or their attire; I don’t remember exactly which, because I was especially focused on Jaime. I don’t know what he was saying to them, but they were laughing wildly. Jaime was serious, but his expression was of satisfaction, or maybe not, maybe it stemmed from his belief in his superiority, of the clear dominance which at that moment he was exerting on his friends.
		</p>

		<p>
			Later that evening I told him: “I saw you near Colonia today. You were with two others.” Perhaps I was mistaken, but it looked like he was blushing. “A friend from the office and his cousin,” he said. “It looked like you were really amusing them,” I added. “Ugh, those two laugh at any nonsense,” Jaime replied.
		</p>

			Then, I think that for the first time in his life, he asked me a personal question, a question that addressed my own worries: “So...when do you think you’ll be able to retire?” Jaime asking me about my retirement! I told him that Esteban had talked to a friend about expediting the process. But he can only do so much. And besides, before anything, I inevitably have to turn 50. “And how do you feel?” Jaime asked. I laughed and limited myself to a shrug. I didn’t say anything for two reasons. First, I still don’t know what I’m going to do when I retire, and second, I was moved by Jaime’s sudden interest. Today was a good day.
