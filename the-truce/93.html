		<h3>Sunday, June 30th</h3>

		<p>
			From breakfast time on, it was a busy day for us. When I arrived I was anxious to check and verify everything. What happened on Friday was a unique, but torrential occurrence. Everything happened so quickly, so naturally, so happily, that I couldn’t even make a single mental note. When one is in the very center of life, it is impossible to reflect upon it. And I want to reflect, take the most approximate measure possible of this strange thing which is happening to me, recognize my own signs, and compensate for my lack of youth with my excess of conscience. And among the details I want to verify is the tone of her voice, its nuances, from extreme sincerity to ingenuous pretense; her body, which I virtually didn’t see, couldn’t discover, because I preferred to deliberately pay that price provided there would be less tension that way, that her nerves would yield space to her senses. I preferred that the darkness really be impenetrable, light-proof against any illuminated crack, provided that her trembling embarrassment, fear, what do I know, would gradually change into other warmer, normal, and natural forms of trembling submission. Today she told me: “I’m happy that everything is behind us,” and appeared, by the force of  her words and the light of her eyes, to be referring to an exam, childbirth, an attack, or anything of a more major risk and responsibility than the simple, current, and daily act of a man and his woman going to bed, much more simple, current and daily than the act of a man and a woman going to bed. “I would even say I don’t feel guilty, that I’m free of sin.” I must have made an impatient gesture because she quickly clarified herself, and said: “I know you can’t understand it, that it’s something which is beyond the extensive comprehension of the masculine mentality. For you men, making love is a kind of normal transaction, a hygienic obligation, rarely a matter of conscience. It’s enviable how you can separate that detail called sex from everything else that’s essential, from all other areas of life. It was you men who invented the theory that sex means everything to a woman. You invented the theory and then you distorted it, converting it into a caricature of what it really means. When men say this, they think of women as being a vocational reveler, unrepentant. Sex means everything to a woman, which is to say: the entire life of a woman, with her cosmetics, her art of deception, her burnishing of culture, her quick tears, and all her tools of seduction to trap the man and turn him into the furnisher of her sexual life, sexual demands, and sexual rituals.” She was excited and even appeared annoyed with me. She was looking at me with such an assured irony, that she looked like the trustee of all feminine dignity of this world. “And none of that is true?” I asked, just to provoke her, because she looked so pretty with her aggressive attitude. “Some of that is true, sometimes,” she replied. “I know there are women who are like that and nothing else. But there are others, the majority, who aren’t like that, and still others, who even if they are, are more than that, they are complicated human beings, egocentric, and extremely sensitive. Perhaps it’s true that the feminine ego is synonymous with sex, but one has to understand that a woman identifies sex with conscience. That’s where the most guilt, the greatest happiness, and the hardest problem might lay. It’s so different for you men. Compare, if you like, the case of an old maid and an old bachelor, who on the surface might appear to be kindred human beings, like two frustrated parallels. What are the reactions of one and the other?” She took a breath and continued.

			“While the old maid becomes irritable, less and less feminine, fussier, and more hysterical and unfulfilled, the old bachelor, on the other hand, turns to his outward appearance, and becomes exciting, loud, and obscene. Both of them suffer from loneliness: for the old bachelor it’s only a problem of domestic help, of a single bed, but for the old maid, loneliness is a heavy blow to the back of the neck.” It was very inopportune of me, but at that moment I laughed. She halted her speech and looked at me inquisitively. I find it amusing to hear you defend old maids,” I said. “It pleases and surprises me to see you so preoccupied with formulating your theory. You must inherit this from your mother. She has her theory about happiness, and you have your own; one that could perhaps be defined as ‘of the bond between sex and conscience in the average woman.’ But now tell me, where did you get the idea that men think that way, that it was men who invented that wholesome nonsense about sex meaning everything to a woman? She became embarrassed, knowing she was cornered, and said: “What do I know? Someone told me. I’m not a scholar. But if a man didn’t invent it, then he deserves to have invented it.” Now I was really beginning to recognize her again, in that posture of a little girl revealed who resorts to a twist of seeming naiveté just to absolve herself. After all, I don’t much care for her feminist outbursts. In short, she had said all of this in order to explain why she had stopped feeling guilty. Well, that was the important thing, that she not feel guilty, to ease her tension, and feel comfortable in my arms. The rest is embellishment, justification; whether it’s there or not, it’s all the same to me. If she likes to feel justified, if she turns all of this into a serious problem of conscience, and wants to talk about it, wants me to understand, to hear her say it, well, then let her speak and I’ll listen. She looks very pretty with her cheeks flushed with excitement. Furthermore, it’s not true that this wouldn’t be a matter of conscience for me. I don’t know which day I wrote it, but I’m sure I placed my uncertainties on the record, and what is vacillation if not an evasion of one’s conscience?

			But she’s amazing. All of a sudden she became silent, put aside her militancy, looked at herself in the mirror, not in a flirtatious manner, but as if making fun of herself, sat on the bed and called me: “Come, sit here. I’m an idiot who’s wasting time with such as speech. Anyway, I know you’re not like the others. I know you understand me, you know why this is a real matter of conscience for me.” I had to lie and said: “Of course, I know.” But at that point she was in my arms and there were other things to think about, old plans to carry out, new caresses to attend to. Matters of conscience also have their tender side.
