		<h3>Sunday, January 26th</h3>

		<p>
			For the first time, I reread my diary from February to January. I have to look for all of Her Moments. She first appears on February 27th. On March 12th, I wrote: “When she says: ‘Mister,’ she always blinks. She isn't beautiful, but her smile is passable. Something is better than nothing.” I wrote that, I once thought that about her. On April 10th: “I’m attracted to something about Avellaneda, that’s obvious. But what is it?” Well, and what was it? I still don’t know. I was attracted to her eyes, her voice, her waist, her mouth, her hands, her laugh, her weariness, her shyness, her tears, her honesty, her sorrow, her trust, her tenderness, her sleep, her walk, her sighs. But none of those traits was enough to attract me compulsively, totally. Every attractive trait supported another. I was attracted to her as a whole, as an irreplaceable sum of attractiveness, perhaps replaceable. On May 17th, I told her: “I think I’m in love with you,” and she had replied: “I already knew.” I keep saying this to myself, I hear her saying it, and everything about the present time becomes unbearable. Two days later I said: “What I’m boldly looking for is an accord, a kind of agreement between my love and your freedom.” She had replied: “I like you.” It’s horrible how much those three words hurt. On June 7th, I kissed her and that night I wrote: “Tomorrow I’ll think about it. Now I’m tired, or I could also say: happy. But I’m too alert to feel completely happy. Alert about myself, about good luck, and that sole tangible future called tomorrow. Alert, that is to say: distrustful.” Still, what good did that distrust do? Did I perhaps take advantage of it to live more intensely, more eagerly, more urgently? No, by no means. Afterwards, I acquired a particular sense of security, I thought everything was fine if one was conscious of loving, loving with an echo, with repercussion. On June 23rd, she talked to me about her parents and her mother’s theory about happiness. Perhaps I should replace my unyielding Universal Mother-in-Law with this good image, with this woman who understands, forgives. On the 28th, the most important event of my life took place. I, of all people, ended up praying. “May it last,” and to pressure God I knocked on wood.” But eventually, God proved to be incorruptible. Still, on July 6th, I allowed myself to write: “All of a sudden, I realized that that moment, that slice of everyday life, was the highest degree of well-being, it was Happiness.” But I quickly slapped myself alert: “I’m sure the pinnacle is only a brief second, an instantaneous flash, and it’s unfair to make it any longer.” I was being dishonest when I wrote that, however; I know better now. Because deep down, I had faith there would be extensions, that the pinnacle wouldn’t just be a point, but a long, endless plateau. But there was no right to extensions, of course not. Afterwards, I wrote about the word “Avellaneda,” and all of the meanings it had. Now I think: “Avellaneda,” and the word means: “She’s not here, she’ll never be here again.” I can’t.
