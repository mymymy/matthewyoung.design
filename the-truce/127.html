		<h3>Saturday, August 24th</h3>

		<p>
			I rarely think about God. Nevertheless, I have a religious background, a yearning for religion. I would like to convince myself that I truly have a definition of God, a concept of God. But I don’t have anything like that. I rarely think about God, simply because the concept exceeds me so amply and eminently that it provokes a kind of panic, a general disbandment of my clarity and rationality. “God is the Totality,” Avellaneda says often. “God is the Essence of everything,” says Aníbal, “that which keeps everything in balance, in harmony; God is the Great Coherence.” I’m capable of understanding both definitions, but neither is my definition. It’s likely that they’re right, but that’s not the God I need. I need a God I can talk to, a God I can turn to for refuge, a God that will answer to me when I question Him, when I strafe Him with my misgivings. If God is the Totality, the Great Coherence, if God is only the energy that keeps the Universe alive, if He’s something so immeasurably infinite, why would He care about me; an atom, crudely perched on an insignificant louse of His Kingdom? I don’t mind being an atom of the last louse of His Kingdom, but I do care that God be within my reach, I care about grabbing hold of Him, not with my hands, of course, not even with my reasoning. I care about holding him with my heart.
