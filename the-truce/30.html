		<h3>Monday, April 1st</h3>

		<p>
			Today I was sent to meet the “Jew who comes looking for work.” He comes around every two or three months and the manager doesn’t know how to get rid of him. He’s a tall man, freckled, about fifty years old, who speaks Spanish horribly and probably writes it even worse. In his same old speech, he always reminds us that his specialty is being able to correspond in three or four languages, write shorthand in German, and cost accounting. He extracts a badly deteriorated letter from his pocket in which the head of personnel from some institute in La Paz, Bolivia, certifies that Mr. Franz Heinrich Wolff performed his job to their complete satisfaction and left of his own free will. However, the expression on the man’s face is as distant as it can be from his own will or that of anyone else’s. We already know all of his tics, lines of reasoning, and his resigned attitude, by heart. Still, he always insists on being tested. But when we put him to work using a typewriter, the letter always turns out poorly and then he responds to the few questions asked of him with a peaceful silence. I can’t imagine what he lives on. He seems clean and miserable at the same time. He seems to be inexorably convinced of his failings; he doesn’t consent to the minimum possibility of being successful, yet he accepts the obligation of being stubborn and cares little about many shattering rejections he must face. I couldn’t say whether the spectacle was pathetic, repugnant, or sublime, but I think I will never be able to forget the look on his face (serene? resentful?) with which he always receives the poor results of his test and the semi-reverence with which he says good-bye. Occasionally, I have seen him on the streets, walking slowly or simply observing the river of people who walk by and who perhaps might inspire him to reflect. I  think he’ll never be able to smile. His gaze could be that of a lunatic or a scholar, or a con-artist or someone who has suffered a great deal. But the truth is that every time I see him, I feel uncomfortable. It’s as if I was partly to blame for his present condition, his misery and – worse of all – it’s as if he believed I am really to blame. I know it’s nonsense. I can’t get him a job in my office; besides, he isn’t any good.

			Well then? Perhaps I know of other ways to help a fellow man. But what are they? Advice, for example? I don’t even want to think about the look on his face with which he would accept any advice from me. So today, after I told him no for the tenth time, I felt a wave of pity come over me and felt inclined to extend my hand with a ten peso bill. He left me with my hand outstretched, stared at me (a very complicated look, although I think the main ingredient of it was, in turn, pity) and in that disagreeable accent of “r’s” that sound like “g’s” said to me: “You don’t understand.” Which is absolutely true. I don’t understand and that’s the end of it. I don’t want to think about any of this anymore.
