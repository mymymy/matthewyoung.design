		<h3>Friday, May 10th</h3>

		<p>
			I met Diego, my future son-in-law. My first impression:
		</p>

		<p>
			I like him. He has a determined look, and speaks with the kind of pride that (it appears to me) isn’t gratuitous, that is to say, which relies on some portion of his attributes. He treated me with respect, but without flattering me. There was something I liked about his overall attitude, and I think my vanity appreciated it, too. He was very biased in my favor, that was obvious. And from what other source could that bias have come from if not from his conversations with Blanca? I would be really happy about this detail at least, if I knew my daughter has a good impression of me. It’s interesting; for example, I don’t care about Esteban’s opinion of me. On the other hand, I really do care about Jaime and Blanca’s opinion. Perhaps the overly elaborate reason consists in that, despite the fact that the three of them mean quite a bit to me, despite seeing many of my impulses and inhibitions reflected in the three of them,  in Esteban I’ve also noticed a kind of discrete hostility, a variance of hatred that he doesn’t dare confess even to himself. I don’t know which occurred first, his rejection or mine, but the truth is I don’t love him as much as I love the others. I’ve always felt distant from this son who is never at home, talks to me as if it were an obligation, and makes all of us feel like “strangers” in “his family,” made up of him and only him. Jaime also doesn’t feel very inclined  to talk to me, but in his case I don’t notice that kind of irrepressible rejection. Jaime is, by nature, a hopeless loner, and everyone else eventually pays the price.

			Getting back to Diego: it pleases me that the young man has character, it will be good for Blanca. He’s a year younger than she is, but he looks four or five years older. The main thing is that she feels protected; as far as Blanca is concerned, she’s faithful and won’t disappoint him. I like the fact they go out alone together, without a cousin or little sister tagging along as chaperone. Camaraderie is a beautiful stage; irreplaceable and irretrievable. I’ll never forgive Isabel’s mother for her behavior during our courtship; she would always stick to us like plaster and would watch us so closely and zealously that even if one was the epitome of purity, one would still feel forced to summon all of one’s available sinful thoughts. Even on those truly rare occasions when she wasn’t present, we didn’t feel we were alone; we were sure that some kind of ghost with a shawl on its head was watching every move we made. If on some occasion we kissed, we were so nervous and so concerned that she’d appear at any of the cardinal points of the living room, that the kiss always ended up being merely instantaneous contact, with little sexuality and even less tenderness, but with a good dose of fear, short circuitry, and damaged nerves.  She’s still alive; I saw her near Sarandí the other afternoon, tall, determined, ageless, accompanying the youngest of her six daughters and a pitiful man who looked like a suitor who was in custody. The young girl and the candidate weren’t walking arm-in-arm: there was at least eight inches of light between them. You can see the old woman still hasn’t budged from her famous motto: “The arm, when you get married.”

			But again, I stray from the Diego topic. He says he works in an office, but that it’s only temporary. “I can’t be satisfied with the prospect of seeing myself always there, locked in, swallowing the smell of old books. I’m sure that I’m going to be and do something else. I don’t know if it will be better of worse than what I’m doing now, but it will be something else.” There was a time when I also thought like that. Nevertheless, nevertheless....This fellow looks more determined than I did.
