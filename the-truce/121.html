			“Tell me about Isabel.” That’s one good thing about Avellaneda: she makes you discover things about yourself, makes you get to know yourself better. When one spends a great amount of time alone, when many, many years go by without life-giving and exploratory dialogue encouraging one to deliver that modest civilization of the soul called lucidity to the most intricate zones of instinct; to those truly virginal lands, unexplored, of desire, of emotion, of loathing, when that solitude becomes routine, one inexorably begins to lose the capacity to feel shaken, to feel alive. But then Avellaneda comes and asks questions, and in addition to her questions, I ask myself many more, and then yes, I feel alive and determined. “Tell me about Isabel” is an innocent, simple request, but still...Isabel’s affairs are my affairs, or they were; they are the affairs of that man I was when Isabel was alive. My God, what immaturity! When I first met Isabel, I didn’t know what I wanted, nor did I know what to expect from her or from myself. There were no modes of comparison, since there were no standards for identifying happiness or sorrow. The good moments were later shaping the definition of happiness, while the bad moments served to create the formula of sorrow. That’s also called freshness, spontaneity; but how many abysses exist in the spontaneous! In the midst of everything, I was lucky. Isabel was a good woman, and I wasn’t a fool. Our union was never complicated. But what would have happened if the passage of time had worn away that threatened attraction of sex? “Tell me about Isabel” was an invitation to be sincere. I knew the risk Avellaneda was taking. Retrospective jealousies (because of their impossible resentment, their lack of challenge, and their improbable competence) are frightfully cruel. Nevertheless, I was sincere. I related the details about Isabel which were really hers. And mine. I didn’t invent an Isabel who would allow me to show off in front of Avellaneda. Naturally, I had the impulse to do so. Because one always likes to make a good impression, and after making a good impression, one wants to make an even better impression for the person one loves, in front of whom we, in turn, try to distinguish ourselves in order to be loved. First of all, I didn’t invent her because I think Avellaneda is worthy of the truth, and then, because I too am worthy, because I’m fatigued (and in this case fatigue is almost disgusting) with pretense, that pretense that one puts on like a mask over one’s old sensible face. That’s why I’m not amazed that, as Avellaneda began to learn what kind of person Isabel had been, I too began to learn what kind of person I had been.
