		<h3>Saturday, June 29th</h3>

		<p>
			It looks like Esteban’s illness isn’t so serious. The X-ray and the tests contradicted the doctors’ poor diagnosis. That doctor likes to terrify his patients by announcing the proximity of at least serious complications and undefined and relentless dangers. Afterwards, if the reality isn’t too dreadful, suddenly there is a great sense of relief, and it’s this relief felt by the family that usually provides the best scenario for paying an abusively high bill, without a fuss, and even with gratitude. When one humbly asks, almost embarrassed, and clearly feeling the shame of bringing up such a trivial and coarse subject in front of someone who sacrifices his life and time for the welfare of fellow human beings: “How much is it, doctor?” he always says, his words accompanied by a generous and understanding gesture of discomfort: “Please, my friend, there will be plenty of time to talk about that. And don’t worry, you’re never going to have a problem with me.” And immediately, in order to redeem the human dignity of this sordid pause, he changes the subject and launches into a lecture about the broth the convalescent will be eating tomorrow. Then, when the time finally comes to talk about the doctor’s fee, the inflated bill arrives, alone, by mail, and one is a little stunned by the amount, perhaps because at that moment, the pleasant, paternal, and Franciscan smile of that austere martyr of science isn’t present.
