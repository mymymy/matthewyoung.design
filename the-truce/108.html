		<h3>Monday, July 22nd</h3>

		<p>
			I carefully prepared the meeting, but Avellaneda didn’t know anything about it. We were in the pastry shop. We don’t go out together very often. She’s always nervous and thinks someone from the office is going to see us together. I tell her that it has to happen sooner or later; we’re not going to spend the rest of our lives locked up in the apartment. She noticed my gaze over her cup and said: “Who did you see? Someone from there?” “There” is the office. “No, this person isn’t from there,” I replied. “But it’s someone who wants to meet you.” She became so nervous that for a moment I regretted having conducted this test. She followed the direction of my gaze and recognized her before I had a chance to say anything else. After all, Blanca must have some feature of mine. I called her with a gesture. She looked pretty, happy, and delightful. I felt very proud to be her father. “This is my daughter, Blanca,” I said. Avellaneda extended her hand. She was trembling. Blanca, on the other hand, was quite calm. “Please, relax,” Blanca said. “It was I who wanted to meet you.” But Avellaneda wasn’t recovering her composure. She was very nervous, and was mumbling: “Jesus, I can’t get used to the idea that he’s spoken to you about me. I can’t get used to the idea that you wanted to meet me. Forgive me, I must sound like I don’t know what....” Blanca and I were doing all we could to calm her down. In spite of everything, though, I noticed that a thread of sympathy had extended itself between the two of them. They’re almost the same age. Little by little, Avellaneda began to relax; but even so, she still shed a tear. Ten minutes later, they were already talking like two normal and civilized people. And I let them. It was a new pleasure to have both of them near me, the two women who I love the most. When we parted company (Avellaneda insisted that I accompany Blanca), we walked in the drizzle for a few blocks before taking the bus. Afterwards, when we arrived at the apartment, Blanca gave me a hug, one of those hugs which she doesn’t squander and for that very reason, are more memorable. With her cheek next to mine, she said: “I really like her. I never thought you had such good taste.” I ate very little and went to bed. I’m so tired I feel as if I have had an entire year of hard labor. But what does it matter.
