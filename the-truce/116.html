		<h3>Thursday, August 8th</h3>

		<p>
			What a relief! I turned down the position. The manager smiled self-satisfied, satisfied because he doesn’t like me as a co-worker, and also because my rejection of his offer will help him qualify all the good reasons which he surely must have offered to oppose my promotion. “It’s what I was saying: a man who’s finished, a man who doesn’t want to fight. What we need for this position is someone who is active, vital, ambitious, and not someone who is worn out.” I seem to see his filthy thumb print on this vulgar, boastful, and egocentric little game. Case closed. What peace!
