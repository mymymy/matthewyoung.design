		<h3>Saturday, September 14th</h3>

		<p>
			Nevertheless, yesterday’s date didn’t pass in vain. Several times during the day today, I thought: “Fifty years,” and my heart sank. I was in front of the mirror and I couldn’t avoid feeling a little bit of pity and a desire to commiserate with that wrinkled fellow with tired eyes who never amounted to anything and ever will. The most tragic thing is not being mediocre, but being unaware of that mediocrity; the most tragic thing is being mediocre and know that one is like that and not be satisfied with that destiny that, moreover (that’s the worse part), is strictly justified. Then, while I was looking at myself in the mirror, Avellaneda’s head appeared over my shoulder. When that wrinkled fellow who never amounted to anything and never will, saw her, his eyes lit up, and for two and a half hours forgot that he was now fifty years old.
