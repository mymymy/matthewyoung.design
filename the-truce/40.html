		<h3>Sunday, April 14th</h3>

		<p>
			This morning I took the bus and got off at Agraciada and 19 de Abril. It’s been years since I’ve been around there and I pretended that I was visiting an unfamiliar city. Only now do I realize that I’ve become accustomed to living on streets without trees and how irremediably cold these streets can be.

			One of the most pleasant things in life is seeing how the sun filters through the leaves.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was a good morning. But this afternoon I took a nap for four hours and woke up in a bad mood.
