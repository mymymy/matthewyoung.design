		<h3>Friday, June 21st</h3>

		<p>
			Suárez was fired, it’s unbelievable, but he was fired. The staff happily fostered the rumor that the Valverde woman had urged that he be fired. But what’s most surprising is that he couldn’t have been fired for a lesser reason. The Shipping Department sent two packages to the wrong address. Suárez didn’t even know about those two packages, which were surely shipped by one of those inexperienced and absent-minded fellows who are in charge of making packages. In the not-too-distant past, Suárez had made any number of terrible mistakes and no one had said anything. Apparently, during the last three or four days, the manager had the responsibility of discharging this disgraced lover; but Suárez, who sensed he was going to be fired, had been behaving like an exemplary child. He would arrive on time and there were even days when he would work an extra hour or so. He was also kind, humble, and disciplined. But it still didn’t do him any good because even if that shipping error hadn’t occurred, I’m sure he still would have been fired; either for smoking too much or for not having his shoes shined. On the other hand, some refined individual  maintains the packages were sent to the wrong address under the confidential and direct orders of management. Nothing would surprise me.

			It was a pity to watch Suárez after he received the news. He went to the Payroll Department, collected his severance pay, and then returned to his desk and started to empty the drawers. He did this in silence, without anyone approaching him to ask what was wrong, give him advice, or offer to help. In just a half hour he had become an undesirable. I haven’t spoken to him in years (since the day I realized he would lift confidential data from Accounting, pass it on to one of the Directors, and then turn him against the others) but I swear that today I felt like approaching him to offer words of sympathy, comfort. But I didn’t, because he’s a filthy pig and doesn’t deserve it. I couldn’t help feeling a little disgusted about that sudden and complete change of attitude (in which everyone participated, from the Chairman of the Board to the kitchen servants) based purely and exclusively on the suspension of relations between Suárez and Valverde’s daughter. It might seem strange, but the atmosphere in this commercial enterprise depends, to a great extent, on a private orgasm.
