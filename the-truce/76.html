		<h3>Friday, June 7th</h3>

		<p>
			Until now, we had gone to the movies together twice, but afterwards she would go home alone. Instead, today I accompanied her home for a change. She had acted very warm and friendly. Halfway through the film, as Alida Valli put up with the idiotic Farley Granger, I suddenly felt her hand resting on my arm. I think it was a reflex, but the fact is that afterwards she didn’t remove it. Inside me there is a gentleman who doesn’t want to force anything, but there is also another gentleman, who obsessively thinks about hurrying.

			We got off the bus at 8th of Octubre and walked the three blocks. It was dark, but simply the clear darkness of the night. The UTE, the old and dependable public utility company was giving me a blackout as a present. We were walking side by side, about three feet apart. But as I approached a corner (a corner with a department store that had a pool table illuminated by candle light on display), someone slowly appeared out of the shadow of a tree. Then, the three feet that separated us disappeared, and before I realized it she was giving me her arm. The owner of the shadow was a drunk, a harmless and defenseless drunk who was mumbling: “Long live the poor wretched and the National Party!” Meanwhile, I felt she was stifling a little laugh and loosening the tension of her fingers on my arm. Her house is number 368 and is on a street with a name like Ramón P. Gutiérrez or Eduardo Z. Domínguez, I don’t remember. The house has an entrance hall and several balconies. The main door was closed, but she told me there is an inner windproof storm door reminiscent of stained glass windows. “They say the owner wanted to imitate the stained glass windows of Notre Dame, but I’m telling you, there’s a St. Sebastian on that glass who looks like Gardel.”

			She didn’t open the door right away. As she leaned gently against the door, I thought about how the bronze railing must be digging into her spinal column. But she wasn’t complaining. Then she said: “You’re very good. I mean to say, that you’re well-behaved.” And I, who know myself, lied like a saint and said: “Sure I’m very good, but I’m not sure that I’m behaving myself.” “Don't be cocky,” she said. “When you were young, weren’t you taught that when one behaves oneself, one doesn’t have to acknowledge it?” The moment had arrived and she was waiting for it: “When I was young I was taught that every time one behaves, one receives a prize. Don’t I deserve one?” There was a moment of silence. I couldn’t see her face because the foliage of a damn municipal pine tree was blocking the light of the moon. “Yes, you deserve it,” I heard her reply. Then her arms emerged from the dark and rested on my shoulders. She must have seen this move in some Argentine film. But I’m sure she didn’t see the kiss that followed in any film. I like her lips, I mean to say, their taste, the way they submerge themselves, open halfway, and slip away. Naturally, it’s not the first time she’s kissed someone. So what? After all, it’s a relief to kiss on the mouth again, with trust and affection. I don’t know how, or what strange step we must have taken, but the truth is, all of a sudden, I felt the bronze hand railing sinking into my spinal column. I was at the door of number 368 for a half an hour. Lord, what progress. Neither of us said anything, but after this episode one thing was clear. Tomorrow I’ll think about it. Now I’m tired, or I could also say: happy. But I’m too alert to feel completely happy. Alert about myself, about good luck, and about that sole tangible future called tomorrow. Alert, that is to say: distrustful.
