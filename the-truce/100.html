		<h3>Wednesday, July 10th</h3>

			Vignale. I bumped into him along Sarandí. I didn’t have any choice but to stop and listen to him. He didn’t sound happy. I was in a hurry, so we drank a cup of coffee at the counter. There, in a loud voice, in that thundering style of confidence he cultivates, he related the latest chapter of his romance: “What terrible luck. My wife caught us, understand? She caught us in the act. We were just kissing. But you can imagine the commotion she caused. For such a thing to occur in her own house, under her own roof, eating her own bread. I, her own husband, felt like a cockroach. Elvira, on the other hand, took it quite calmly and stated the theory of the century: that she and I had always been like brother and sister and what my wife had seen was just that, a brotherly kiss. I felt very incestuous and my wife caused a huge scene. You’re being naïve, she said, if you think I’m going to remain passive like that idiot Francisco. She spoke to my mother-in-law, the neighbors, the grocer. Two hours later the entire neighborhood knew that Elvira, that tramp, had tried to steal her husband. For her part, Elvira had a harsh talk with Francisco, and told him that she was being insulted, and that she wouldn’t stay in that house for one more minute. She stayed for about three hours, during which time she did something very nasty to me; and I mean really very nasty. Just think, Francisco would agree with everything, he wasn’t dangerous at all. But fatso was insisting, screaming, and two or three times tried to attack Elvira. And then Elvira, in one of those moments of terror said.... Well, I bet you don’t know what she told her. She said, who would ever think that she’d notice trash like me. Understand? And worst of all is that by saying that, she convinced her and Fatso calmed down. Do you understand? I swear I’m not going to forgive Elvira for this. Her and her little cuckold should just leave. After all, she’s not as good looking as I thought. Besides, now that I’m no longer a faithful husband, I’ve arrived at the conclusion I can have much younger, fresher love affairs, which above all, would have no connection to my family, which for me was always sacred. That way, poor fatty doesn’t have to worry.”
