		<h3>Tuesday, January 28th</h3>

		<p>
			There are so many other things in this diary, so many other faces: Vignale, Aníbal, my children, Isabel. None of that matters, none of that exists. While Avellaneda was here, I had a better understanding of Isabel’s time, and of Isabel herself. But now she isn’t here, and Isabel has disappeared behind a thick, dark curtain of despondency.
