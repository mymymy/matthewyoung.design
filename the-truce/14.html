		<h3>Tuesday, March 12th</h3>

		<p>
			It’s good to have an intelligent employee. Today, as a test for Avellaneda, I told her everything about the Comptroller all at once. While I spoke, she took notes. When I finished she said: “Look sir, I think I understood quite a bit, but I have doubts about a few points.” Doubts about a few points.... Méndez, who had earlier concerned himself with those doubts, needed no less than four years in which to dispel them. Afterwards, I put her to work at the desk to my right. Every now and then, I would sneak a look at her. She has pretty legs. Since she still doesn’t work spontaneously, she becomes tired. Furthermore, she’s nervous and restless. I think that my position (poor rookie) inhibits her a bit. When she says: “Mr. Santomé,” she always blinks. She isn’t beautiful, but her smile is passable. Better than nothing.
