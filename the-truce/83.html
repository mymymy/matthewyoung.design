		<h3>Thursday, June 20th</h3>

		<p>
			I haven’t written anything in four days. Between the process of renting the apartment, the security agreement, the withdrawal of the $2,465.79, and the purchasing of some furniture, I’ve been tremendously stressed. I can move in tomorrow. My furniture will be delivered on Saturday.
