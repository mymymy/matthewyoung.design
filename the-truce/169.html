		<h3>Sunday, February 16th</h3>

		<p>
			I went to pick up the suit this morning. Mr. Avellaneda was just finishing the ironing. The photograph filled the entire room and I couldn’t stop looking at it. “It’s my daughter,” he said, “my only daughter.” I don’t know what I said nor do I care to remember. “She died recently.” Once again I heard myself say: “I’m sorry.” “It’s strange,” he quickly added, “now I think that I was distant, that I never showed her how much I needed her. Ever since she was little I’ve been postponing the long chat I had promised myself to have with her. At first I didn’t have time, then, she started to work, and furthermore, I’m rather a coward. It scares me a little, you know, to feel sentimental. The truth is that now she’s no longer here and I’ve been left with that weight on my chest, those unspoken words which could have been my salvation.” He stopped talking for a moment and gazed at the photograph. “Many times I thought she hadn’t inherited a single trait of mine. Do you see any?” “A general resemblance,” I replied, lying. “There could be,” he said. “But when it comes to her soul, she was really like me. Or rather, like the way I used to be. Because now I feel defeated, and when one allows oneself to be defeated, one becomes deformed, and turns into a gross parody of oneself. Look, my daughter’s death was a dirty trick played on her, either by destiny or the doctor, I’m not sure which. But I am sure it was a dirty trick. If you would have known her, you would understand what I’m trying to tell you.” I blinked my eyes ten times in a row, but he wasn’t paying attention. “Only via a dirty trick can a woman like her be extinguished. She was (how can I explain?) a pure being, and at the same time intense, and modest about her intensity. She was a delight. I was always convinced I didn’t deserve her. But her mother did deserve her, because Rosa is a character; Rosa is capable of confronting the world. But I lack determination, confidence. Have you ever thought about suicide? I have. But I’ll never be able to go through with it. And that, too, is a deficiency. Because I have the whole mental and moral framework to commit suicide, but not the necessary strength to put a bullet in my temple. Perhaps the secret lies in that my brain has some of the needs peculiar to the heart, and my heart has some of the subtleties particular to the brain.” Once again he stopped talking, this time while holding the iron in the air, looking at the photo. “Look at her eyes. Notice how they continue to look, beyond habit, and despite her death. They even seem to be looking at you.” The remark lingered in the air. I felt out of breath. He was left with nothing to say. “Well, they’re ready,” he said, carefully folding the pants, “it’s a very smooth fabric. Look at how well they look pressed.”
