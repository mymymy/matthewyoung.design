		<h3>Saturday, August 31st</h3>

		<p>
			Avellaneda and Blanca were seeing each other without me knowing about it. Blanca let a little remark slip and everything came out into the open. “We didn’t want to tell you because we’re learning quite a bit about you,” said Blanca. At first I thought it was a bad joke, but later I felt moved. I didn’t have any other choice but to imagine the two women exchanging their respective incomplete images about this simple man that I am. A kind of jigsaw puzzle. There’s something curious about all this, of course, but there’s also affection. For her part, Avellaneda felt very guilty, apologized, and for the hundredth time said that Blanca was wonderful. I like that they’re friends; for me, through me, and because of me, but sometimes I can’t help feeling superfluous. Actually, I’m an old-timer, being taken care of by two girls.
