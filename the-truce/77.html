		<h3>Sunday, June 9th</h3>

		<p>
			Perhaps I’m very fussy about the middle ground. Whenever I’m presented with a problem, I never feel attracted to extreme solutions. It’s possible this is the root of my frustration. One thing is obvious: if, on the one hand, extremist attitudes provoke enthusiasm, drag others down, and are signs of strength, then on the other hand, poised attitudes are generally annoying, sometimes disagreeable and almost never seem heroic. In general, one needs plenty of bravery (a very special kind of bravery) to maintain one’s poise, but it can’t be denied that to others it will look like a show of cowardice. Besides, poise is boring. And nowadays, boredom is a great drawback that people generally don’t forgive.

			But what does all of this mean? Oh, yes. The middle ground I now search for has to do with (is there anything in my life just now that doesn’t have to do with her?) Avellaneda. I don’t want to hurt her, nor hurt myself (first middle ground); I don’t want our bond to drag along the absurd situation of a betrothal headed toward matrimony, nor that it acquire the tinge of a common and vulgar affair (second middle distance); I don’t want the future to condemn me to be an old man disdained by a woman in full use of her senses, nor that due to a fear of that future, I shall remain on the margin of a present time such as this, so attractive and unexchangeable (third middle ground); I don’t want to roam from motel to motel, nor do I want us to create a home, with a capital H.

			Solutions? First: rent a little apartment, but without abandoning my house, of course. Well, first and done. There are no other solutions.
