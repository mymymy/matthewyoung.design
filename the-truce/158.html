		<h3>Friday, January 17th</h3>

		<p>
			It’s been almost four months since I’ve written anything in this diary. On September 23rd, I didn’t have the courage to write about what happened that day.
		</p>

		<p>
			On September 23rd, at three o’clock in the afternoon, the telephone rang. Surrounded by employees, paperwork, and proposals, I picked up the receiver. A man’s voice said: “Mr. Santomé? Look, this is one of Laura’s uncles speaking. Sir, I have bad news. Very bad news. Laura passed away this morning.”
		</p>

		<p>
			In the first moment I didn’t want to understand. Laura wasn’t anyone, she wasn’t Avellaneda. “She passed away,” her uncle’s voice had said. The words are disgusting. “Passed away” signifies a formality: “Sir, I have bad news,” her uncle had said. But what does he know? What does he know about how bad news can destroy the future, the aspect of the face, the sense of touch, the ability to sleep. What does he know, huh? The only thing he knows how to say is: “She passed away,” something as unbearably easy as that. I’m sure he was even shrugging his shoulders when he gave me the bad news, and that too is disgusting. And that’s why I did something quite horrible: with my left hand I crumpled a sales account into a ball, and with my right hand I brought the receiver closer to my mouth and slowly said: “Why don’t you go to hell?” I don’t remember exactly, but I think the voice asked: “What did you say, sir?” several times, to which I repeated: “Why don’t you go to hell?” several times in reply. And then the receiver was taken away from me and someone spoke to the uncle. I think I screamed, gasped for air, and spoke gibberish. I could hardly breathe. I felt my collar being unbuttoned and my tie being loosened. Then there was an unfamiliar voice that said: “It’s been an emotional shock,” and another voice, this one quite familiar, Muñoz’s voice, that started to explain: “She was an employee he held in great esteem.” In that nebula of sounds there were also Santini’s sobs, Robledo’s crude explanation of the mystery surrounding death, and the manager’s ritual instructions about sending a wreath. Between Sierra and Muñoz, they finally managed to put me in a taxi and bring me home.
		</p>

			Blanca was very frightened when she opened the door. But Muñoz quickly calmed her down: “Don’t worry miss, your father is perfectly fine. Do you know what happened? A colleague passed away this morning and he took the news quite hard. And it’s no wonder, she was a great girl.” He too said: “Passed away.” Well, maybe the uncle, Muñoz, and the others might all do well by saying “passed away,” because those words sound so ridiculous, so cold, so far away from Avellaneda, that they can’t harm her, can’t destroy her.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then, when I was at home, alone in my room, when even poor Blanca withdrew the comfort of her silence, I moved my lips to say: “She died. Avellaneda died,” because “died” is the word, “died” is the collapse of life, “died” comes from within, brings the real breath of pain, “died” is despair, the frigid and total void, the simple abyss, the abyss. Then, when I moved my lips to say: “She died,” then I saw my filthy solitude, that which remained of me, which was very little. With all the selfishness at my disposal, I thought about myself; the anxious, mended man I would now become. But at the same time, that was the most generous way to think of her, the most complete way to imagine her. Because up until three o’clock in the afternoon on September 23rd, I had much more of Avellaneda than I had of myself. She had begun to enter me, to become me, like a river that blends with the sea too much and finally becomes salty like the sea. That’s why when I would move my lips and say: “She died” I felt pierced, stripped, empty, worthless. Someone had arrived and decreed: “Strip this man of four-fifths of his being.” And they did strip me. Worst of all, this remnant that I now am, that fifth part of me that I’ve become, is still, however, conscious of its small amount and insignificance. I’ve been left with one-fifth of my good resolutions, my good plans, my good intentions, but the one-fifth part of my sanity that has remained is enough to make me realize that what I’ve been left with is useless. The matter has simply come to an end. I didn’t want to go to her house, I didn’t want to see her dead, because it was an unseemly disadvantage. That I should see her, but that she not see me. That I should touch her, but that she not touch me. That I should be alive, but that she is dead. She is something else, she is her last day, there I can treat her as an equal. It’s her getting out of the taxi with the cough medicine I had bought her, it’s her taking a few steps and turning around to gift me a gesture. The final, the final, the final gesture. I cry and cling to it. On that day I wrote that I was certain there was communication between us. But this certainty existed while she existed. Now my lips move to say: “She died. Avellaneda died,” and the certainty is extinguished, it is a shameless, unseemly condition, which doesn’t belong here. I returned to the office, of course, to the piercing, putrefying, sickening comments. “Her cousin told me it was a simple and common case of the flu, and then suddenly, bang! She had heart failure.” I went back to work again, resolved matters, answered inquiries, and wrote reports. I am truly an exemplary civil servant. Sometimes, Muñoz, Robledo, or even Santini himself, approach me and try to initiate an evocative chat with introductory remarks like the following: “To think that Avellaneda did this job,” “Look boss, Avellaneda wrote this annotation.” Then I divert my eyes and say: “Well, it’s all right, one has to keep on living.” The points I gained on September 23rd, I’ve since lost with interest. I know they mumble that I’m indifferent, an egotist, that someone else’s misfortune doesn’t affect me. But their mumbling doesn’t matter. They’re on the outside. Outside that world which Avellaneda and I had been in. Outside that world in which I am now, alone like a hero, but with no reason to feel brave.
