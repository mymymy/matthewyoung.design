		<h3>Wednesday, March 13th</h3>

		<p>
			When I arrived at home from downtown this afternoon, Jaime and Esteban were screaming at each other in the kitchen. I managed to overhear Esteban saying something about “your rotten friends.” When they heard my footsteps, they stopped screaming and tried to talk in a normal tone. But Jaime’s lips were pressed together and Esteban’s eyes were shining. “What’s going on?” I asked. Jaime shrugged his shoulders and Esteban said: “It’s none of your business.” What an urge I had to punch him in the mouth. That’s my son, with that harsh face that nothing or anyone will ever loosen up. It’s none of my business. I walked over to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of milk and the butter. I felt unworthy and ashamed. It didn’t seem possible that he could say to me: “It’s none of your business” and that I could remain so calm, without doing or saying anything to him. I poured myself a large glass. It didn’t seem possible that he could scream at me in the same way that I should be screaming at him, but nevertheless, did not. It’s none of my business. Each drink of milk hurt my temples. All of a sudden I turned around and grabbed him by the arm. “Have more respect for your father, understand? More respect!” It was stupid to say this now that the moment had already passed. Esteban’s arm was tense and hard, as if it had suddenly turned into steel or perhaps lead. The back of my neck hurt when I lifted my head to look him in the eyes. It was the least I could do. No, he wasn’t scared of me as he flared his nostrils and easily shook his arm free from my grasp and said: “When are you going to grow up?” and left, slamming the door behind him. I don’t think I could have had a calm look on my face when I turned around to face Jaime and saw that he was still leaning against the wall. He smiled spontaneously and only said: “What nastiness, Dad, what nastiness!” It’s incredible, but at that precise moment I felt my anger starting to solidify. “But it’s also that your brother...,” I said, without conviction. “Forget it,” he replied. “At this stage there is no hope for any of us.”
