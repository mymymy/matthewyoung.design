		<h3>Saturday, August 3rd</h3>

		<p>
			I spoke to her about it for a long time. She tells me to think about it very carefully, that the Assistant Manager position is comfortable, pleasant, respectable, and well-paying. Really, what I already know. But I also know I have the right to rest and I won’t sell that right for a hundred peso raise in salary. Perhaps I wouldn’t sell it even if the offer were much higher. The essential thing for me has always been that the salary I earn be enough to live on. And it is enough. I have a good salary. I don't need a raise. Not even now, with the added expense of the apartment. Besides, when I retire, I think I can depend on a slightly higher income (almost a hundred pesos more), since the bonuses I’ve received have raised my average income considerably over the last five years, and also, I won’t have any deductions. Of course, I should be mindful of the drop in the value of currency, which is the surest guarantee of inflation. The threat is real, but I always have the opportunity to do some bookkeeping, secretly, more or less. But of course, Avellaneda brandishes, also, other reasons which are more moving, and less concrete than all this sordid foresight: “If you’re not there, the office is going to be unbearable.” Even better. She doesn’t convince me with this remark either, because I have a plan: that when I retire, Avellaneda stop working. The amount I’ll receive will be enough for both of us. Besides, we’re both moderate people. Our pastimes are, for obvious reasons, strictly domestic. On occasion, the movies, a restaurant, a pastry shop. On a Sunday, when it’s cold but sunny, we might stroll along the shore, to breathe fresh air. We buy a book, a record, but more than anything, we amuse ourselves by talking, about us, referring to every area of our lives that happened before Our Thing. There is no pastime, no spectacle that can replace what we enjoy during that exercise of sincerity and openness. And we’re already getting better at it. Because one also has to get accustomed to sincerity. In light of all these years during which Aníbal was abroad, with all my problems of communication in my relationship with my children, with the defensive modesty which always protected my private life from the maliciousness of the office, because of my solely hygienic closeness to women, always new, never repeated, it’s obvious I had become unaccustomed to sincerity. It’s even probable that I only sporadically practiced it with myself. I say this because on occasion, during these frank dialogues with Avellaneda, I’ve found myself pronouncing words that seemed more sincere to me than even my own thoughts. Is that possible?
