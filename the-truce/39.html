		<h3>Friday, April 12th</h3>

		<p>
			Last night, Vignale arrived at eleven and left at two o’clock in the morning. His problem is very simple: his sister-in-law is in love with him. It is worth transcribing, albeit roughly, Vignale’s version of the story: “Just look, they’ve been living with us for the past six years. Six years isn’t four days. I’m not going to tell you that up till now I’ve never noticed Elvira. You already know she’s very pretty. And if you were to see her in a bathing suit, you would be knocked speechless. But hey, looking is one thing, taking advantage is another. What do you want from me? My wife is already middle-aged and besides, doing the housework and taking care of the kids has exhausted her. You can imagine that after fifteen years of marriage, it’s not a matter of looking at her and ipso facto becoming aroused with passion. Besides, some of her periods last two weeks, so it’s very difficult for me to arrange my desires to coincide with her availability. The truth is I’m hungry for sex quite often, so I feed on Elvira’s calves with my eyes, who, to make matters worse, always wears shorts in the house. The thing is that Elvira has misinterpreted the way I look at her; well, actually, she hasn’t, but there’s no need to make such a fuss. The fact of the matter is that if I had known Elvira was interested in me earlier, I wouldn’t have paid her any attention because the last thing I want is to create a scandal and disrupt my own home, which for me has always been sacred. First, there was the exchange of glances and me pretending not to notice. But the other day she was wearing those shorts when she simply crossed her legs and I had no other choice but to say to her: ‘Be careful.’ She replied: ‘I don’t want to be careful,’ and that was the last straw. Then she asked me if I was blind, that I well knew that I wasn’t unresponsive towards her, etc., etc. Although I was sure it was a waste of time and effort, I reminded her about her husband, that is to say, my brother-in-law, and  you know what she said? ‘Who? That moron?’ And the worse thing is that she’s right, Francisco is a moron. That’s what mitigates my scruples a bit. ‘What would you do in my place?’

			In his place I wouldn’t have any problems: first of all, I wouldn’t have married that idiot woman, and second, I wouldn’t be at all captivated by that other middle-aged woman’s soft flesh. But I couldn’t tell him anything beyond the commonplace: “Be careful because you won’t be able to get rid of her. If you want to break up your family, then go ahead, but if your family means more to you than anything, then don’t take the risk.”
		</p>

			He left remorseful, preoccupied, and undecided. I think, however, that Francisco runs the risk that his wife will deceive him.
