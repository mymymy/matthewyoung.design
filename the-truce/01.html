		<h3>Monday, February 11th</h3>

		<p>
			In only six months and twenty-eight days I’ll be in a position to retire. I’ve been doing this daily calculation of the time remaining for at least the past five years. Do I really need leisure so much? I tell myself no, that it’s not leisure that I need, but the right to work at what I love. For example? The garden, perhaps. It’s good as a restful activity on Sundays, for counteracting sedentary life, and also as a secret defense against my future and guaranteed arthritis. But I fear I couldn’t bear it every day. The guitar, perhaps. I think I would like it. But it must be lonely to start studying music at forty-nine. Write? Perhaps I wouldn’t be too bad at it, at least people usually enjoy my letters. And so what? I can imagine a short bibliographical note about “the considerable merits of this author who is nearing fifty” and the mere possibility of it repulses me. That I should still feel naïve and immature (with only the defects of youth and almost none of its virtues, that is) doesn’t mean that I have the right to display that naiveté and immaturity. I once had a spinster cousin who, when she made a dessert, would show it to everyone with a sad and childish smile. She had worn that smile since the time during which she had strived to impress her motorcyclist-boyfriend who afterwards killed himself on one of our many very dangerous “Death Curves.” She dressed appropriately, suitable to her fifty-three years; in that and everything else she was discrete, and poised, but that smile lay claim, on the other hand, to a twenty year-old’s lips, magnificent skin, and shapely legs. It was merely a pathetic gesture, a gesture that could never appear ridiculous, because in that face there was also kindness. So many words just to say I don’t want to seem pathetic.
