		<h3>Tuesday, July 23rd</h3>

		<p>
			I haven’t seen Avellaneda since yesterday, when Blanca and I parted company with her. In the office early today, she approached my desk with two account books for a consultation. We’re always careful at the office (until now, no one has noticed). But today I watched her carefully. I wanted to know how she had fared in that test I conducted yesterday. She looked serious, very serious, and was almost wearing no rouge. I gave her the instructions. We were surrounded by people, so we couldn’t say anything to each other. But as she walked away, she took the opportunity to leave me two receipt books and a little slip of paper containing a single scribbled word: “Thanks.”
