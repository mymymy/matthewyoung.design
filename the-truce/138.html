		<h3>Wednesday, September 4th</h3>

		<p>

How did Avellaneda behave during that time so that those callous men now behave so emotionally? Even the manager called me, and among other matters we discussed, dropped the following absentminded question on me: “How is that young woman you have in your department? I have good reports about her work.” I formulated some measured praise in the most conventional tone in the world. But the Crab continued, adding: “Do you know why I was asking?
