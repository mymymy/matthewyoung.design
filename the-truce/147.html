		<h3>Friday, September 13th</h3>

		<p>
			Today is my 50th birthday. That is to say, from this  day forward, I’m in position to retire. It’s a date that seems made to take stock. But I’ve been taking stock all year long. I’m infuriated with the anniversaries, the happy occasions, and the grieving in fixed installments. For example, I think it’s depressing that on November 2nd it’s our duty to cry as a chorus for our dead, that on August 25th we should all become excited at the simple sight of the national flag. One is or isn’t, regardless of the day.
