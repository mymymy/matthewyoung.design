		<h3>Thursday, February 6th</h3>

		<p>
			The thought occurred to me the other night and today I acted on it. At five o’clock I rushed out of the office. When I arrived at number 368 and rang the bell, I felt an itch in my throat and started to cough.
		</p>

		<p>
			The door opened and I was coughing like a wretch. It was her father, the same father in the photographs, but much older, sadder, and more tired. I coughed harder, trying to finally overcome the coughing spell, and managed to ask if he was the tailor. He tilted his head to one side to say yes. “Well, I want to have a suit tailored,” I said. He led me into his workshop. “Never ask him to tailor a suit for you,” Avellaneda had said, “he uses the same mannequin for the size of every suit.” There it was – undaunted, mocking, mutilated – the mannequin. I chose the fabric, recited a few details, and settled on the price. Then he went to the back door and without shouting, called out: “Rosa.” “My mother knows about us,” she had said, “my mother knows everything about me.” But “Us” didn’t include my name, my face, my height. For the mother, “Us” was Avellaneda and a nameless lover. “My wife,” said the father, “Mr...., what did you say your name was?” “Morales,” I said, lying. “Right, Mr. Morales.” The mother’s eyes had a penetrating sadness about them. “He’s going to have a suit tailored.” Neither of them was wearing mourning clothes. There was a light, natural bitterness. The mother smiled at me and I had to look away towards the mannequin, because I wasn’t strong enough to bear that smile which had been Avellaneda’s. She opened up a little notebook and the father started to take my measurements, dictating two digit numbers. “Are you from the neighborhood? Seventy-five,” the father said. “More or less,” I replied. “I ask you because your face looks familiar. Fifty-four,” the father said. “Well, I live downtown, but I come around here very often,” I said. “Oh, no wonder. Sixty-nine,” he said. She wrote automatically, facing the wall. “You want the pant bottoms to rest on the shoes, correct? One zero seven.” I have to return next Thursday, for the fitting. There was a book on the table: Blavatsky. The father had to leave the workshop for a moment. The mother closed her little notebook and looked at me. “Why did you come to have my husband tailor a suit for you? Who recommended him?” she asked. “Oh, no one in particular. I knew that a tailor lived here, that’s all,” I replied. It sounded so unconvincing that I became embarrassed. She looked at me again. “He works very little now. Since my daughter died.” She didn’t say “passed away.” “Oh, of course. And has it been long?” I asked. “Almost four months,” she replied. “I’m sorry, madam,” I said, and I, who feel it not quite like sorrow, but more like a catastrophe, a collapse, like chaos, I was conscious of the lie, because to say: “I’m sorry,” to say those words of condolence, so frivolous, so late, was simply frightening, it was almost  like saying: “passed away.” And it was especially frightening because I was saying it to the only person who could really understand, who could understand the truth.
