		<h3>Saturday, March 16th</h3>

		<p>
			This morning the new man, Santini, tried to confess to me. I don’t know what it is about my face that always invites the trust of others. They look at me, smile, and some of them even pull that long face that precedes sobbing; after which they proceed to open their hearts. And, frankly, there are some hearts I’m not attracted to. The comfortable shamelessness and tone of mystery with which some men speak confidentially about themselves is incredible. “Because, you know sir, I’m an orphan,” he said from the outset in order to fasten me in pity. “Pleased to meet you, and I’m a widower,” I replied with a ritual gesture, intended to destroy his brazenness. But my widowhood moves him less than his own orphan-hood.

			“I have a little sister, you know?” As he spoke, standing next to my desk, he tapped his skinny, fragile fingers on the cover of my journal. “Can’t you leave that hand still?” I screamed. He stopped, but not before smiling sweetly. I noticed he wore a gold bracelet with a little medallion attached. “My little sister is seventeen, you know?” The “you know?” is a kind of tic. “You don’t say? And is she good looking?” This reply was my desperate defense before the dikes of his final mimicry of scruples would burst, and I would find myself completely overwhelmed by his private life. “You don’t take me seriously,” he said, pressing his lips together tightly and walked to his desk very offended. He doesn’t work very fast. It took him two hours to close out the month of February.
