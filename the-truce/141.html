		<h3>Saturday, September 7th</h3>

		<p>
			I met with Esteban’s friend. It’s practically assured that I’ll be able to retire within four months. It’s curious: the closer I get to my retirement, the more unbearable the office is. I know there are only four months of entries, counter-entries, balance sheets, order accounts, and sworn declarations remaining. But I would give a year of my life if those four months were reduced to zero. Well, on second thought, I wouldn’t give a year of my life because now my life has Avellaneda.
