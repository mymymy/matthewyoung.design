		<h3>Thursday, February 13th</h3>

		<p>
			It was the day of the fitting, but the tailor wasn’t there. Mr. Avellaneda wasn’t there. His wife told me so when I had already entered the workshop. “He couldn’t wait for you, but he left everything prepared so that I could do the fitting.” She went into the other room and returned with the jacket. It looked terrible on me. So it was true after all, he did use the same mannequin to tailor every single suit. Suddenly, I turned to one side (actually, she slowly turned me with the excuse of placing pushpins in the jacket and making chalk marks) and I ended up in front of a photograph of Avellaneda which hadn’t been there last Thursday. The blow was too sudden, too brutal. The mother was watching me and her eyes took good note of my sad stupor. Then  she placed the remaining pushpins and chalk on the table, and smiled sadly, already sure, before she asking: “You...are?” Between the first and second word there was a two or three second interval, but that silence was enough to subtly reveal the transparency of her question. I felt obliged to respond. And I did, without saying a word; with my head, with my eyes, with all of my being I said: yes. Avellaneda’s mother placed her hand on my arm, that arm which still didn’t have a sleeve and was emerging from that clumsy stitching attempt. Afterwards, she slowly took the jacket off of me and placed it on the mannequin. How good it looked on it! “You want to know, right?” she said. I was sure she wasn’t looking at me with resentment or shame, nor anything that wasn’t an exhausted, stoical pity. “You knew her, you loved her, and must be distraught. I know how you feel. You feel that your heart is an enormous entity that begins in the stomach and ends in the throat. You feel miserable, and happy by feeling miserable. I know how horrible that is.” She spoke as if she had met with an old confidant, but there was also something in her voice that was more than her actual grief. “I had someone die on me twenty years ago. Someone who was everything to me. But it wasn’t a physical death. He simply left. The country, my life; especially my life. That is a worse kind of death, I assure you. Because it was I who asked him to leave, and to this day I haven’t forgiven myself. That kind of death is worse, because one remains imprisoned in one’s own past, destroyed by one’s own sacrifice.” She ran her hand along the back of her neck and I thought she was going to say: “I don’t know why I’m telling you these things.” But instead she said: “Laura was all I had remaining of him. That’s why I feel, once again, that the heart is an enormous entity in the stomach and ends in the throat. That’s why I know what you’re going through.” She brought a chair over and sat down, exhausted. I then asked: “And what about her, what did she know about that?” “Nothing,” she replied. “Laura knew absolutely nothing. I am the sole owner of my story. It’s a meager pride, isn’t it?” Suddenly, I remembered something and said: “And your theory of happiness?” She smiled, almost defenseless, and said: “Did she tell you about that too? Well, it was a beautiful lie, a fairy tale so that she wouldn’t lose her footing, so my daughter would feel alive. It was the best gift I ever gave her. Poor thing.” She was crying, her eyes aloft, without running her hand across her face; she was crying with pride. “But you want to know,” she said. And then she told me about Avellaneda’s final days, final words, and final moments. But that will never be written down. That is Mine, incorruptibly Mine. That will be waiting for me at night, every night, for when I reclaim the thread of my insomnia, and say: “Love.”
