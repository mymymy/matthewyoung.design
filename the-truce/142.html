		<h3>Sunday, September 8th</h3>

		<p>
			We made love this afternoon. We’ve done it so many times, and yet, I still haven’t registered it. But today was marvelous. Never in my life, not with Isabel nor with anyone, have I ever felt so close to bliss. Sometimes I think Avellaneda is like a shoe mold which has positioned itself in my chest and is expanding it, putting it in the adequate condition to feel more each day. The truth is that I ignored having those reserves of tenderness in me. And I don’t care that this is a word without prestige. I have tenderness and I’m proud to have it. Even desire becomes pure, even the act most definitively devoted to sex becomes almost immaculate. But that purity isn’t prudishness, it isn’t pretense, it isn’t pretending that I’m only concerned with my soul. That purity means loving every centimeter of her skin, breathing in her scent, surveying her abdomen, pore by pore. It means bringing the desire to its summit.
