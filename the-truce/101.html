		<h3>Saturday, July 13th</h3>

		<p>
			She’s here, next to me, asleep. I’m writing on loose-leaf paper and tonight I’ll copy it into the diary. It’s four o’clock in the afternoon and the end of siesta. I began to think about one comparison and ended up with another. It is here, next to me, her body. It’s cold outside, but in here it’s pleasant, even hot. Her body is almost completely exposed, as the sheet and blanket have slipped to one side. I tried to compare this body next to me with my memories of Isabel’s body. But apparently, those were different times. Isabel wasn’t thin, her breasts had volume, and that’s why they sagged a bit. Her navel was large, sunken inwards, and dark with thick edges. Her hips were her best feature, they’re what attracted me to her the most and I have a tactile memory of them. Her shoulders were well rounded and rosy white. Her legs were threatened by a future of varicose veins, but they were still beautiful, then, and very shapely. This body next to me now, has absolutely no features in common with that other one. Avellaneda is thin, her bust inspires a bit of pity in me, her shoulders are covered with freckles, her navel is small and infantile, her hips are also her best feature (or could it be that I’m always aroused by hips?), and her legs are skinny, but well developed. Nevertheless, Isabel’s body attracted me once, and now Avellaneda’s body attracts me. There was an inspirational force in Isabel’s nudity, as I would look at her and my entire being would immediately become sex; there was no reason to think about anything else. There is a sincere modesty in Avellaneda’s nudity, pleasant and unarmed, a touching helplessness. I’m profoundly attracted to it, but with Avellaneda, sex is only part of the suggestion, the appeal. Isabel’s nudity was total, purer perhaps. Avellaneda’s body is nudity with an attitude. To love Isabel it was enough to feel attracted to her body. To love Avellaneda it’s necessary to love her nudity and the attitude, since that is at least half of  her attraction. To hug Isabel meant hugging a body which was sensitive to every physical reaction and also capable of every permissible stimulation. To hug Avellaneda’s distinctive thinness means also hugging her smile, her gaze, her way of speaking, the repertory of her tenderness, her reticence to completely surrender, and her apologies for her reticence. Well, that was the first comparison. But then came the second one, and it left me gloomy, depressed. My body with Isabel and my body with Avellaneda. How sad! I’ve never been an athlete, God forbid. But I once had muscles, strength, and smooth tight skin. Above all, though, my body didn’t have as many other features as it unfortunately has today. From my uneven baldness (the left side is more barren), my wider nose, and the wart on my neck, to my chest with islands of red hair, my rumbling stomach, my varicose ankles, and my incurable, depressing mycosis. But when I’m in front of Avellaneda I don’t care, because she knows this is how I am and doesn’t know how I once looked. But it matters to me, because I care about seeing myself as a ghost of my youth, a caricature of myself. But perhaps there’s some compensation: with my head, and my heart, in short, as a spiritual person, perhaps I’m a little better today than I was during those days and nights with Isabel. But only a little better, because it’s not a good idea to over indulge in illusions. Let’s be balanced, objective, sincere, and so forth. The answer is: “Does that count?” God, if He exists, is probably up there crossing Himself. Avellaneda (oh, she exists) is down here, now opening her eyes.
