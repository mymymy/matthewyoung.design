		<h3>Thursday, July 18th</h3>

		<p>
			I had two things to say to Avellaneda, but we were in the apartment for only an hour and during that time I only talked about Jaime. She didn’t say I was totally blameless, and I appreciated it. Mentally, of course. But I also think that when a person is rotten, there is no education that will cure him, or any amount of attention that will straighten him out. Of course, I could have done more for him, that is so true, so true, that I can’t feel blameless. Besides, what do I want, what would I prefer? That he not be a queer, or that I simply feel free of all blame? How selfish we are, my God, how selfish I am! Even, feeling up to date with my conscience is a kind of selfishness, of fondness for convenience and the comfort of the spirit. I didn’t see Jaime today.
