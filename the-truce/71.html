		<h3>Tuesday, May 28th</h3>

		<p>
			She comes to have coffee with me almost every day. The general tone of our conversation is always one of friendship. At most, about friendship and something more. But I’m making progress with that “something more.” For example, we sometimes talk about “Us”. “Us” is that undefined link that now binds us together. But whenever we mention it, it’s as outsiders. I will explain: we say, for example, that “no one in the office has noticed what’s going on between Us yet,” or that such and such a thing happened before Us began. But, in the end, what is Us? For now, at least, it’s a kind complicity we’re faced with, a secret sharing, a unilateral pact. Naturally, this isn’t an affair, or an arrangement, or – much less – a betrothal. Nevertheless, it’s more than a friendship. What’s worse (or better?) is that she feels comfortable with this lack of definition. She talks to me with complete trust, humor, and I think even affection. She has a very personal and ironic point of view on that which surrounds her. She doesn’t like to hear jokes about the office people, but she has them all well catalogued. Sometimes, in the café, she looks around, and makes a well-informed accurate, and unsurpassable comment. Today, for example, sitting at a table were four or five women, all of them about thirty or thirty-five years old. She looked at them carefully for some time and then asked me: “They’re court clerks, right?” Yes indeed, they were court clerks. I’ve known a few of them, at least by sight, for years. “Do you know them?” I asked her. “No, I’ve never seen them before,” she replied. “So then, how did you guess?” I asked. “I don’t know,” she replied. “I can always recognize women who are court clerks. They have very special characteristics and habits you don’t see in other professional women. They either apply lipstick in one hard stroke, like someone who writes on a blackboard, have an eternal sore throat from reading so many documents, or don’t know how to carry their purses because they’ve carried portfolios for so long. They speak haltingly, as if they don’t want to say anything that goes against the codes, and you’ll never see them look at themselves in a mirror. Look at that one, the second one from the left, she has calves like a runner-up champion athlete. And the one next to her looks like she doesn’t even know how to fry an egg. They annoy me, how about you?” No, they don’t annoy me (even more, I remember a court clerk who is the owner of the most attractive bust in this universe and its surroundings), but I amuse myself by listening to her enthusiastically discuss the pros and cons of something. The poor clerks – mannish, energetic, and muscular – continued talking, completely unaware of the demolishing criticism that, one table away continued to add new reproaches regarding their appearance, posture, attitude, and conversation.
