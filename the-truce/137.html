		<h3>Tuesday, September 3rd</h3>

		<p>
			For the first time, Avellaneda talked to me about her old boyfriend. His name is Enrique Ávalos and he works at city hall. They dated for exactly one year, from April of last year to this past April. “He’s a good man. I still have respect for him, but...,” said Avellaneda. I realize that I was always afraid of this explanation, but I also realize that my greatest fear was that it would never come. If she dared to mention it, it was because the subject was no longer that important. In any case, all of my senses were hanging on that “but,” which sounded like celestial music to me. This is because Ávalos had had his advantages (his age, his looks, the mere fact of meeting her first, but perhaps hadn’t known how to make good use of them. My advantages began with that “but” and I was prepared to make good use  of them, that is to say, to undercut poor Enrique Ávalos’ position. Experience has taught me that one of the most efficient ways to defeat a rival in the vacillating heart of a woman is to praise that very rival, to become so understanding, so noble and tolerant, that even oneself feels moved. “Really, I still have respect for him, but I’m sure I wouldn’t have been even moderately happy with him,” said Avellaneda. “Well, why are you so sure? Haven’t you said that he’s a good man?” I asked. “Of course he is,” she replied. “But that’s not enough. I can’t even complain that he was too frivolous and I too profound, because neither am I so profound that a good dose of frivolity would bother me, nor is he so frivolous that he wouldn’t be moved by a truly deep sentiment. The difficulties were of a different kind. I think the most insurmountable obstacle was that we didn’t feel we were able to talk to one another. He exasperated me; I exasperated him. It’s possible that he loved me, who knows, but the truth is he had a special ability for hurting me.” How wonderful. I had to make an enormous effort to prevent the satisfaction I was feeling from swelling up in my cheeks, to take on the preoccupied look of someone who truly regrets that her relationship had ended in disappointment. I even had the strength to plead for my enemy: “And did you consider whether or not you shared the blame? Perhaps he hurt you simply because you were always expecting him to hurt you. Living forever on the defensive is, surely, not the most effective way to improve your life together.” Then she smiled and said only: “With you I don’t need to live on the defensive. I feel happy.” And that was greater than my powers of containment and pretense. The satisfaction I was feeling spilled out from all of my pores, my smile stretched from ear to ear, and I no longer cared about devoting myself to destroying forever the still surviving prestige of poor Enrique, a marvelous defeated man.
