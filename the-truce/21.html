		<h3>Thursday, March 21st</h3>

		<p>
			Dinner at Vignale’s house. The house is dark, cramped, and cluttered. There are two armchairs in the living room that are of such an undefined international style that they look like two hairy dwarves. I let myself drop into one of them and felt a wave of heat travel up to my chest. While I sat in the armchair, a little discolored dog with the face of a spinster came to greet me. After looking at me without so much as a sniff, she opened her legs wide and proceeded to commit the classic offense right there on the carpet. The stain appeared precisely on the head of a peacock, which was the star in that rather frightful pattern. But there were so many stains on the carpet that one might think they actually formed part of the design.

			Vignale has a large, noisy and insufferable family. It includes his wife, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and, horror of all horrors, his five children. These could be approximately defined as little monsters. Physically, they look normal, too normal, rosy-cheeked and healthy. Their monstrosity resides in how annoying they are. The oldest is thirteen (Vignale was middle-aged when he married) and the youngest is six. They are constantly running around, making noise, and arguing at the top of their lungs. One gets the feeling that they’re climbing onto one’s back or shoulders, and that they’re always about to stick one of their fingers into your ear or pull your hair. They never get that far,  but the result is the same, and one is aware that in Vignale’s house, a person is at the mercy of that pack of little monsters. The adults in the family have found refuge in an enviable attitude of disregard for them, which doesn’t exclude stray slaps that suddenly cut through the air and land on the nose, temple, or eye of one of those little angels. The mother’s method, for example, could be defined like this: tolerate any kind of attitude or insolence by the one offspring who bothers all the others, including visitors, but punish every gesture or word by the offspring who bothers her personally. The high point of dinner occurred while we were having dessert. One of the kids wanted to leave evidence that the rice pudding hadn’t agreed with him. Said evidence consisted of spilling his portion of the rice pudding onto his youngest brother’s pants. The gesture was celebrated with plenty of noise, but the weeping of the victimized little brother surpassed all of my expectations and is beyond description.

			After dinner the kids disappeared and I didn’t know whether they were getting ready for bed or whether they were preparing a poison cocktail for early tomorrow morning. “What kids!” said Vignale’s mother-in-law. “It’s just that they’re so full of life. That’s what childhood is: pure life,” said the son-in-law as a suitable postscript. In response to a non-existent inquiry on my part, the sister-in-law pointed out: “We don’t have children.”  “And we’ve been married for seven years already,” said her husband with an apparently malicious guffaw. “Personally, I would like to,” the woman explained. “But this one takes pleasure in avoiding them.” It was Vignale who rescued all of us from  such gynecological and contraceptive digressions, to refer to what constituted the main attraction of the evening: the exhibition of the famous old photographs. Vignale kept them in a green homemade envelope made out of construction paper, on which he had printed the words: “Photographs of Martín Santomé.” Evidently, it was an old envelope, but the writing on the front of it had been recent. In the first photograph there were four people standing in front of the house on Brandzen Street. It wasn’t necessary for Vignale to say anything: when I saw the photograph my memory seemed to shake itself out and acknowledge the receipt of that yellowish image that was once sepia. The four people in the photograph were my mother, a neighbor who later moved to Spain, my father, and me. I looked incredibly clumsy and foolish. “This photograph, did you take it?” I asked Vignale. “You’re crazy,” Vignale replied. “I’ve never had enough courage to hold a camera or a revolver in my hand. Falero took that photograph. Do you remember Falero?” Vaguely, I thought. For example, that his father owned a bookstore, and that he would steal pornographic magazines, taking care later to share this fundamental aspect of French culture with us. “Look at this one,” said Vignale, anxiously. I was in that photograph, too, next to Blockhead. Blockhead (him I remember) was an idiot who always attached himself to us, laughed at all of our jokes, even those that weren’t funny, and wouldn’t stop following us around.

			I couldn’t remember his name, but I was sure it was Blockhead. It was the same silly expression, the same flabby skin, and the same gummy hair. I let out a laugh, one of the best laughs I’ve had all year. “What are you laughing at?” asked Vignale. “Blockhead. Look at that face,” I replied. Then Vignale lowered his eyes, looked bashfully at his wife, in-laws, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law, and then said in a hoarse voice: “I thought you didn’t remember that nickname. I never liked being called that.” It took me completely by surprise. I didn’t know what to do or say. So Mario Vignale and Blockhead are one and the same? I looked at him, then looked at him again, and confirmed that he really was stupid, cloying and ignorant. But apparently, this was about some other stupidity, some other cloyness, some other ignorance. It wasn’t about the man called Blockhead in the photograph, how could it be? Now there is something irremediable about both Vignale and Blockhead. Then, I think I stuttered: “But, hey, nobody called you that to hurt your feelings. Remember that Prado used to be called ‘the Rabbit.’” “Don’t I wish they had called me ‘the Rabbit,’” said Blockhead Vignale, remorsefully. And we didn’t look at any more photographs.
