		<h3>Friday, June 28th</h3>

		<p>
			I finally left the office at seven-thirty and went to the apartment. She had arrived earlier, opened with her key, and had settled in. When I arrived, she greeted me happily, without any inhibitions, and once again with a kiss. We ate, talked, laughed, and made love. Everything went so well, it’s not worth writing it down. I’m praying: “May it last,” and to pressure God I’m going to knock on wood, on any wooden object without legs, for good luck.
