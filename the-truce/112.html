		<h3>Tuesday, July 30th</h3>

		<p>
			There is no news from Jaime. Blanca inquired at his office. He hasn’t been to work for the last ten days. As for Esteban, we’ve silently agreed not to talk about the problem. It’s been a blow to him as well. I ask myself how he’ll react when he finds out about Avellaneda. I’ve asked Blanca not to tell him anything, at least for now. Perhaps I exaggerated the issue by putting my children (or permitting them to reach that level) in a position to judge. I’ve fulfilled my obligations to them. I’ve given them guidance, care and love. Well, perhaps I’ve been a bit stingy when it comes to expressing love. But I can’t be one of those people who always goes around carrying their heart on their sleeve. It’s hard for me to be affectionate, even in my love life. I always give less than what I have. That’s my style of loving: a bit reluctant, reserving my maximum effort for only the biggest occasions. Perhaps there’s a reason for this and it’s that I’m obsessed with details, with gradations. So that if I were always displaying a maximum effort, what would I have in reserve for those moments (there are four or five during each life time, per individual) during which one should appeal to the heart in  full? I also feel a slight resentment towards pretentiousness, and to me, walking around with one’s heart on one’s sleeve is just that: pretentious. As for the person who cries every day, what will happen when they are touched by a great sorrow, a sorrow for which they will need their maximum defenses? The person could always commit suicide, but that, after all, is always a poor solution. I mean to say that it’s rather impossible to live in a permanent crisis, creating a susceptibility that immerses one (a kind of daily bath) in minor agonies. The fine ladies, with their habitual sense of psychological economy, say they don’t see depressing movies because “life itself is very bitter.” And there’s some truth to what they say: life itself is bitter enough, for us to become weepish, squeamish, or hysterical, just because something got in our way and doesn’t allow us to continue our excursion towards happiness, which  sometimes lies next to folly. Once, when the kids were going to school, I remember that Jaime was given a homework assignment, one of those recurring compositions on the classic subject of the mother. Jaime was nine years old and came home feeling profoundly miserable. I tried to make him understand that this was going to happen to him many times. He had lost his mother and should resign himself to this, that it wasn’t something to be crying about everyday, and that the greatest proof of love he could offer the memory of his mother was, precisely, to demonstrate that her absence didn’t make him inferior to others. Perhaps it was inappropriate language to use with him at his age. But the truth is he stopped crying, looked at me with alarming hostility, and with the certitude of the preordained, said: “You’re going to be my mother, if not, I’ll kill you.” What did he mean by that? He wasn’t so young that he didn’t know he was making an absurd demand, but perhaps he wasn’t so grown up that he could better conceal his first agony, the first of these daily agonies on which he later focused his spitefulness, his rebelliousness, and his frustrations. The fact that his teachers, his classmates, society, would bring up his mother, made him feel the total impact of her absence for the first time in his life. I don’t know by what wonder of the imagination he blamed me for her absence. Perhaps he thought that if I had taken better care of her, she wouldn’t have disappeared. I was to blame, so therefore, I should be her substitute. “If not, I’ll kill you.” He didn’t kill me, of course, but he began to kill himself, to void himself. Since the man of the family had failed him, he dedicated himself to denying the man he had within himself. Phew! What a complicated explanation for unraveling  such a simple, ordinary, and inalterable fact. My son is a queer. A queer. Like the repulsive Santini, whose sister is a stripper. I would have preferred that he turn out to be a thief, a morphine addict, or an imbecile. I would like to feel pity for him, but I can’t. I know there are rational and even reasonable explanations. I know that many of those explanations would charge me with part of the blame. But why did Esteban and Blanca grow up to be  normal? Why did Jaime deviate and they didn’t? And it just so happens that it’s Jaime, the one I loved the most. No pity. Not now, not ever.
