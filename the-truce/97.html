		<h3>Sunday, July 7th</h3>

		<p>
			A splendidly sunny day, almost autumnal. We went to Carrasco. The beach was deserted, perhaps because it’s the middle of July, and people don’t have the courage to believe in good weather. We sat on the sand. When the beach is empty like this the waves become imposing; only they rule the landscape. In that sense I admit I’m regrettably docile, malleable. I see that relentless and desolate sea, so proud of its foam and power, barely stained by almost unreal ingenuous sea gulls, and I immediately take refuge in  irresponsible admiration. But afterwards, almost right away, the admiration disintegrates, and I start to feel as defenseless as a clam, or a pebble. That sea is a kind of eternity. When I was a child, that sea surged and surged, but it also surged when my grandfather was a child, and when my grandfather’s grandfather was a child. A mobile, but lifeless presence. A presence of dark, unfeeling waves. A witness of history, useless because it doesn’t know anything about history. And what if God was the sea? Also an unfeeling witness. A mobile, but lifeless presence. Avellaneda was also looking at the sea, with the wind in her hair, and almost without blinking. “And you, do you believe in God?”, she asked, continuing the dialogue which I, my thoughts had initiated. “I don’t know, I would want God to exist, but I’m not sure,” I replied. “I’m also not sure that God, if He exists, is going to be satisfied with our gullibility, which is based on a few pieces of scattered and incomplete data.” “But it’s so obvious,” she replied. “You make it complicated for yourself because you want God to have a face, hands, and a heart. God is a common denominator, but we could also call Him the Totality. God is this rock, my shoe, that sea gull, your pants, that cloud, everything.” “And you’re drawn to that? That satisfies you?” I asked. “At least, it inspires respect,” she replied. “I’m not inspired,” I replied. I can’t imagine God being a big corporation.”
