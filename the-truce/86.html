		<h3>Sunday, June 23rd</h3>

		<p>
			I opened the door and stepped aside so she could pass. She entered with short steps, looking all around with extreme attention, as if she wanted to slowly absorb the light, atmosphere, the smell. She passed her hand over the book case and then over the sofa’s upholstery. She didn’t even look toward the bedroom. She sat down, wanted to smile, and couldn’t. It looked like her legs were shaking as she looked at the reproductions on the wall and said: “Botticelli.” She was mistaken, it was Filippo Lippi. There will be time to correct her later. She started to ask about quality, prices, and furniture stores. “I like it,” she said, three or four times.

			It was seven o’clock in the evening, and the sun, almost setting, made the cream colored wall paper look orange. I sat down next to her and she became stiff. She hadn’t even put her purse down. I asked her to hand it to me. “Don’t you remember that you’re not a visitor but the lady of the house?” I remarked. Then, making an effort, she let her hair down a bit, took off her jacket, nervously stretched her legs. “What’s wrong?” I asked. “Are you scared?” “Do I look like it?” she responded. “Frankly, yes,” I replied. “You could be right,” she said. “But not of you or myself.” “I know, you’re just scared of the Moment,” I said. It looked like she was starting to relax. But one thing was true, she wasn’t faking. Her paleness meant she was truly scared. Her attitude wasn’t the same as those female cashiers who accept going to a motel, but whom at the very moment the taxi comes to a stop, punctually become hysterical and scream for their mothers. No, there’s nothing theatrical about her. She was confused and I didn’t want  – perhaps it didn’t suit me – to inquire too much about the causes of her confusion. “It’s just that I have to get used to the idea,” she said, perhaps to satisfy me. She realized I was a bit discouraged. “One always imagines these things a bit differently than they turn out to be,” she said. “But there is something I have to recognize and be grateful to you for. What you have prepared isn’t too different from what I had in mind,” she said. “Since when?” I asked. “Since high school when I was in love with my math teacher,” she replied. The table was set, with those plain yellow plates the saleswoman at the department store had picked out for me. (It’s not completely true, I like them too). I served a cold dish of meat and vegetables and carried out the role of host with dignity. She liked everything, but the tension didn’t allow her to enjoy anything. When the moment to uncork the champagne arrived, she was no longer pale. “Until what time can you stay?” I asked. “Until late,” she replied. “And what about your mother?” I asked. “My mother knows about us,” she replied.

			Obviously, a low blow. That’s not fair. I felt naked, with that desperate bareness of dreams, when one walks around in one’s underwear along Sarandí and the people celebrate this public display from sidewalk to sidewalk. “And why is that?” I dared to ask. “My mother knows everything about me,” she replied. “And your father?” I asked. “My father lives in another world,” she replied. “He’s a tailor. Awful. Never ask him to tailor a suit for you. He uses the same mannequin for the size of every suit. In addition, he’s a theosophist. And an anarchist. He never asks anything. On Mondays he meets with his theosophist friends and they discuss Blavatsky until dawn; on Thursdays his anarchist friends come to the house and they argue about  Kropotkin of Russia, at the top of their lungs. Apart from this, he’s a tender, peaceful man, who sometimes looks at me with such sweet patience and tells me very useful things, the most useful things I have ever heard.” I like it very much when she talks about her family, but I especially liked it today. It seemed like a good omen for the inauguration of our brand-new intimacy. “And what does your mother say about me?” I asked. My mental distress stems from Isabel’s mother. “About you? Nothing. She talks about me.” She finished drinking the rest of the champagne in her glass and wiped her mouth with the little paper napkin. There was nothing left of her lipstick. “My mother says I’m dramatic, that I don’t have serenity,” she said. “With respect to us or everything in general?” I asked. “Regarding everything,” she replied. “Her theory, the great theory of her life, the one that keeps her invigorated, is that happiness, true happiness, is a condition much less angelic and less pleasant than one always tends to dream it is. She says people generally end up feeling miserable, only because they believed that happiness was a permanent sensation of undefinable well-being, joyful ecstasy, and perpetual festivity. No, she says, happiness is much less (or perhaps much more, but in any case something different) and certainly many of those allegedly miserable people are actually happy, but they don’t realize it or admit it, because they think they’re quite distant from the highest state of well-being. It’s similar to what happens to those people who are disillusioned with the Blue Grotto in Capri. What they imagined was a cave of fairies; they didn’t know exactly what it was, but they were sure it was a cave of fairies. But when they arrive they realize that the entire miracle consists of dipping one’s hands in the water and seeing them appear slightly blue and luminous.” Apparently, it pleases her to relate her mother’s thoughts. I think she relays them as if they were an unattainable conviction, but also a conviction she would fervently like to possess. “And you, how do you feel?” I asked. “As if your hands were light blue and luminous?” The interruption brought her down to earth, to the special moment that was this Today. And she replied: “I haven’t placed them in the water yet,” and quickly blushed. Because, naturally, her response could be interpreted as an invitation, or even as a pressing need she had not wanted to express. It wasn’t my fault, but there lay my sudden disadvantage. She stood up, leaned against the wall, and asked in a low tone of voice that she intended to sound pleasant, but was actually glaringly inhibited: “Can I ask you a favor for the first time?” “You may,” I replied, and now I was worried. “Would you let me leave, without  a fuss?” she asked. “Today, only for today. I promise everything will be fine tomorrow.” I felt disappointed, stupid, understanding. “Of course I’ll let you leave. And that settles it,” I replied. But that doesn’t settle it. How could it?
