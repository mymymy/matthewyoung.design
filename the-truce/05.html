		<h3>Thursday, February 21st</h3>

		<p>
			Coming from the office this afternoon, I was stopped in the street by a drunk. He didn’t protest against the government, didn’t say he and I were brothers, and didn’t touch upon any of the innumerable topics of universal drunkenness. He was a strange drunk, with a special light in his eyes. He grabbed me by an arm and practically leaning on me, said: “Do you know what’s wrong with you? You’re going nowhere.” Another man who was passing by at that moment looked at me with a happy dose of understanding and even winked at me in solidarity. But it’s already been four hours and I’m still uneasy, as if I was really going nowhere and I’ve only just now realized it.
