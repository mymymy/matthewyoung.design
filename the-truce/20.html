		<h3>Tuesday, March 19th</h3>

			Avellaneda and I worked together all afternoon in search of discrepancies, the most boring function in the world. A discrepancy of seven hundredths. Actually, it was a combination of two different discrepancies: one of eighteen hundredths and another of twenty-five hundredths. Poor Avellaneda still hadn’t caught on very well. She becomes just as tired doing this type of strictly mechanical work as she does when she has to do work which forces her to think and do research in order to arrive at solutions on her own. Personally, I’m so accustomed to this kind of research that I often prefer it to any other type of work. Today, for example, while she called out the numbers and I checked them off on my adding tape, I practiced by counting the moles on her left forearm. They fall into two categories: five small and three large, one of which is quite big. When she finished calling out the number for November, just to see how she would react, I said: “Have that mole removed. It’s usually nothing, but in one case out of a hundred it could be dangerous.” She blushed and didn’t know where to put her arm. Then she said: “Thank you sir,” and quite uncomfortably continued to read the numbers out loud. When we got to January, I started to read the numbers out loud and she checked them off. Then, I suddenly became aware that something strange was happening and I looked up in the middle of reading a number. She was looking at my hand. Looking for moles? Perhaps. I smiled and once again she became quite embarrassed. Poor Avellaneda. She doesn’t realize that I’m a gentleman and that I would never, ever, make overtures toward an employee in my department.
