		<h3>Wednesday, September 11th</h3>

		<p>
			Even though my birthday is the day after tomorrow, she still showed me the gifts she bought me. First, she gave me the gold watch. Poor dear. She must have spent her entire savings on it. Then, a little embarrassed, she opened a little box and showed the other gift: an elongated little seashell, with perfect features: “I picked it up off the beach at La Paloma, on my ninth birthday. A wave came and left it at my feet, as if in a show of kindness on behalf of the sea. I think it was the happiest moment of my childhood. At least, it’s the one material object that I most love, most admire. I want you to have it, to carry it with you. Do you think it’s ridiculous?”

			Right now it’s in the palm of my hand. We’re going to be good friends.
