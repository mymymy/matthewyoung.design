		<h3>Thursday, April 18th</h3>

		<p>
			The auditor came today: amiable, mustached. No one would have thought he could be so annoying. He started by asking for some data from the last balance sheet and ended by requesting an itemized list which appears in the initial inventory. I spent the day, from morning until afternoon, carting old and shabby books. The auditor was a charming man; he smiled, begged your pardon, and said: “Many thanks.” He was a real delight. Why doesn’t he just die? In the beginning, I was amassing my anger, mumbling, and mentally cursing. Later, my anger turned into a different emotion. I started to feel old. It was I who had entered that data back in 1929; the entries and counter-entries that appeared in the rough draft of the daybook, and the transport figures written in pencil in the cash book. Back then I was just an errand boy, but I was already being given important things to do, even though the moderate glory only went to the boss; in the same way I now attain my glory for the important  things that Muñoz and Robledo do. I feel a little bit like the Herodotus of the company, its registrar and scribe, and the surviving witness to its history. Twenty-five years, five periods of five years, or a quarter of a century. But no, it’s much more startling to say, plainly and simply, twenty-five years. And how my handwriting has changed over these twenty-five years! In 1929, I had uneven penmanship: the lower case “t” did not slant in the same direction as the “d,” “b,” or “h,” as if the same wind had not blown for all of them. In 1939, the lower half of the letters “f,” “g,” and “j,” looked like types of faint fringes, without character or willpower. In 1945, the era of capital letters began and so did my great pleasure in embellishing them with ample curves, spectacular and useless. My “M’s” and “H’s” were big spiders, with cobwebs and all. Now my handwriting has become artificial, level, disciplined, and genuine. Which only proves that I’m a pretender, since I myself have  become complicated, odd, chaotic, and impure. When the auditor suddenly asked me for data corresponding to 1930, I recognized my penmanship; that penmanship from a special period. With the same handwriting that I had written: “Detailed account of salaries paid to personnel in the month of August, 1930,” I had also written: “Dear Isabel,” twice a week. Isabel lived in Melo at the time and I wrote to her every Tuesday and Friday without fail. That had been, well, my handwriting as  a boyfriend. I smiled, carried along by my memories, and the auditor smiled with me. Afterwards, he asked me for another list of captions.
