		<h3>Thursday, August 29th</h3>

		<p>
			I asked Avellaneda to miss a day at the office. I, her boss, authorized her to do it and that’s enough. She stayed in the apartment with me all day. I can imagine how angry Muñoz must be, with two less people in his section, and all of the responsibility resting on his shoulders. Not only can I imagine it, I can understand it. But it doesn’t matter. I’m at an age when time seems to be, and is, irretrievable. I have to desperately hang on to this reasonable happiness that came to look for me and found me. That’s why I can’t become magnanimous, generous, and start thinking about Muñoz’s problems before my own. Life leaves, it’s leaving right now, and I can’t bear that feeling of escape, of expiration, of finality. This day with Avellaneda isn’t eternity, it’s only a day, a poor, insignificant, limited day, which we’ve all, from God on down, have denounced. It’s not eternity, but the instant which, after all, is its only true substitute. So I have to clench my fist,  I have to use up this abundance without any reservations or foresight. Then maybe afterwards, the real leisure will arrive, the guaranteed leisure, and perhaps later there will be more days like this one, and then I’ll think about this distress, this impatience, as a ridiculous waste of energy. Maybe, just maybe. But this “meanwhile” has the comfort and guarantee of what is, of what it’s becoming.

			It was cold. Avellaneda spent the entire day with her jersey and long pants on. She looked like a boy with her hair tied back. I told her she had the face of a newsboy, but she didn’t pay much attention to me. She was busy reading her horoscope. About a year ago someone read her horoscope and predicted her future. Apparently, her current job, and me, especially, would be playing a role in that future. “A very kind, mature man, a little muted, but intelligent.” How about that! That’s me. “What do you think? Can the future be predicted just like that?” Avellaneda asked. “I don’t know if it’s possible, but either way, it seems like a trap to me,” I replied. “I don’t want to know what is going to happen. It would be horrible. Can you imagine how frightening life would be if one knew when one was going to die?” “I’d like to know when I was going to die,” said Avellaneda. “If it were possible to know the date of one’s own death, one could regulate the rhythm of one’s life, exhaust oneself more, or less, according to the remaining balance.” That would seem frightening to me. But the prediction says that Avellaneda will have two or three children, that she’ll be happy, but that she’ll end up a widow (humph!), and that she’ll die of a circulatory illness, in her eighties or thereabouts. Avellaneda is quite worried about the two or three children. “Do you want to have children?” she asked. “I’m not too sure,” I replied. She realizes that my response is caution in the flesh, but when she looks at me I know she would like to have children, at least one. “Don’t become sad,” I say, “if you become sad I’m capable of ordering twins.” She knows what I think, suffers because of it, and clings to the prediction. “And don’t you care about widowhood, even though it would be a clandestine widowhood?” I asked. “I don’t care, because my faith doesn’t extend that far,” she replied. “I know you’re indestructible, that predictions pass near you and don’t touch you.” Nothing more than a young woman perched on the sofa, with her legs curled underneath her, and the tip of her nose red from the cold.
