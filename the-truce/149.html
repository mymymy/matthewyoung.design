		<h3>Sunday, September 15th</h3>

			She laughs. Then I ask her: “Do you know what it means to be fifty years old?” and she laughs again. But perhaps deep down she realizes everything and will start to place very diverse matters on the plates of the scales. Still, she’s a good woman and doesn’t say anything. She doesn’t mention that there will be an inevitable moment when I will look at her without feeling passion, when her hand in mine won’t be an electric shock, when I will hold for her the same affection one preserves for one’s nieces, for the daughters of one’s friends, for the most remote actresses of the cinema; an affection that is a kind of mental decoration, but that can’t harm nor be harmed, can’t create scars nor accelerate the heartbeat; a tame affection, placid, harmless, that looks like a preview of the monotonous love of God. And then I’ll look at her and I won’t be able to feel jealous, because by then the era of turmoil will have ended. When a cloud appears in the clear sky of the septuagenarian, one immediately knows it’s the cloud of death. This must be the most pretentious and ridiculous sentence I’ve allowed to fall onto the pages of this diary. And the most truthful, perhaps. Why is it that the truth is always a little pretentious? One’s thoughts serve to uplift that which is worthy without any excuse, that which is stoic without faltering, balance without reservations, but the excuses, the faltering, and the reservations, are all ensconced in reality, and when we arrive there, they disarm us, weaken us. The worthier the intentions to be fulfilled, the more ridiculous the unfulfilled intentions seem to be. I’ll look at her and I won’t be able to feel jealous of anyone; only jealous of myself, jealousy of this present-day individual who feels jealous of everyone. I went out with Avellaneda and my fifty years, strolling with both of them along 18th. I wanted to be seen with her, but I don’t think I saw anyone from the office. Instead, I was seen by Vignale’s wife, a friend of Jaime’s, and two of her relatives. In addition (what a horrible “in addition”!), on 18th and Yaguarón, I bumped into Isabel’s mother. It’s incredible: so many, many years have passed over both our faces, and yet, when I see her, my heart still jumps; actually, it’s more than a jump, it’s a leap of rage and impotence. She’s such an admirably invincible woman that one can do nothing less than remove one’s hat in her presence. She greeted us with the same aggressive reticence of twenty years ago, and then literally enveloped Avellaneda in a long stare, that was both a diagnosis and despair. Avellaneda felt the jolt, squeezed my arm, and asked me who she was. “My mother-in-law,” I replied. And it’s true: she’s my first and only mother-in-law. Because even if I were to marry Avellaneda, even if I never would have been Isabel’s husband, this tall, powerful, and decisive seventy year old matron, had always been and would always be my Universal Mother-in-Law; inevitable, destined, a woman who descends directly from that God of terror who hopefully doesn’t exist, even if only to remind me that the world is like that, that sometimes the world also stops to contemplate us, with a look which can also be diagnosis and despair.
