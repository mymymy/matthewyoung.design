		<h3>Friday, March 29th</h3>

		<p>
			What a disgusting wind. It was a battle to travel via Ciudadela from Colonia to the Plaza. The wind lifted a girl’s skirt and a priest’s cassock. Jesus, such diverse spectacles! Sometimes I think about what would have happened to me if I had become a priest. Probably nothing. I have a saying that I repeat four or five times a year: “There are two professions for which I am sure I do not have the least calling: the military and the priesthood.” But I think I repeat the phrase out of habit, without the least conviction.
		</p>

			I arrived home with my hair disheveled, my throat burning, and my eyes full of dirt. I washed up, changed, and sat down by the window to drink maté. I felt safe. And also profoundly egotistical. Sitting there, I watched men, women, old people and children, all struggling against the wind, and now also against the rain. Still, I didn’t get the urge to open the door and offer them refuge in my house and a   hot maté. And it’s not that it didn’t occur to me to do it. The idea did cross my mind, but I felt profoundly ridiculous about it and began to think about the confused look on  people’s faces, even in the middle of the wind and rain.

			What would I be like, today, if twenty or thirty years ago I had decided to become a priest? Yes, I already know, the wind would lift my cassock and expose the pants of a rustic and ordinary man. But, what about the rest? Would I have won or lost? I wouldn’t have children (I think I would have been an honest priest, one hundred percent chaste), an office, a work schedule, or retirement. Yes, I would have God and I would have religion. But, is it that perhaps I don’t have them now? Frankly, I don’t know if I believe in God. Sometimes I think that, in case He does exist, He wouldn’t be upset by my doubts. In reality, the resources that he (or He?) Himself has given us (reasoning, sensibility, intuition) aren’t absolutely sufficient to guarantee us of His existence or non-existence. Thanks to a hunch, I can believe in God and guess right, or not believe in God and also guess right. And then? Perhaps God has the face of a croupier and I’m just a poor fool that bets on red when black comes up, and vice versa.
