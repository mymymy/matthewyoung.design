		<h3>Friday, April 5th</h3>

		<p>
			A letter from Aníbal. He became bored in San Pablo and is returning at the end of the month. For me, that’s good news. I only have a few friends and Aníbal is the closest. Or at least he’s the only friend I can talk to about certain topics without feeling foolish. Someday we’ll have to explore just what our relationship is based on. He is Catholic and I’m not religious at all. He is a womanizer, and I limit myself to the essential. He is active, creative, emphatic; and I’m unimaginative and indecisive. The truth is, on many occasions, he pushes me to make a decision; and at other times, it is I who curbs him with my doubts. When my mother died — it will be fifteen years in August — I was a wreck. Only a fervent hatred of God, relatives, and fellow man sustained me during that period. Every time I remember the interminable wake, I feel disgust. Those who attended were divided into two classes: those who started to cry as soon as they walked through the door, and then shook me in an embrace, and those who came out of courtesy, shook my hand with wearying remorse, and ten minutes later were telling dirty jokes. And then Aníbal arrived. He approached, didn’t even shake my hand, and started to talk in a natural, unaffected way about me, himself, his family, and even my mother. His natural manner was a kind of balm, a real consolation; I interpreted it as the finest homage that anyone could pay to my mother and me during my grief. It was merely a gesture, an almost insignificant episode, this I well understand. But it occurred during one of those moments in which the pain of loss makes one exaggeratedly receptive.
