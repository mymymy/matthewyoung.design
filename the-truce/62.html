		<h3>Wednesday, May 15th</h3>

		<p>
			I was in the café at 25th and Misiones from twelve-thirty to two o’clock in the afternoon. It was an experiment. “I have to talk to her,” I thought, “so she has to show up.” I started  to “see” her in every woman who came by 25th. Now I didn’t really care if there wasn’t a single detail about this or that figure which would remind me of her. I was still “seeing” her all the same; it was a sort of magical game (or idiotic, depending on one’s point of view) I played. It was only when the woman was a few steps away that I would I have an abrupt mental relapse and stop seeing her, substituting the desired image for the undesirable reality. Until, all of a sudden, the miracle occurred. A young woman appeared at the corner and I immediately saw Avellaneda in her, the image of Avellaneda. But as I began to have my already familiar relapse, it turned out that reality was also Avellaneda. My God, what a shock! I thought my heart had become lodged in my temples. She was two steps away, next to my window. I said: “Hello, how you are? What are you up to?” The tone was natural, almost routine. She looked surprised, pleasantly surprised I think, I hope. “Oh, Mr. Santomé, you scared me.” Without any emphasis and an indifferent gesture of my right hand I extended an invitation to her: “A cup of coffee?” “No, I can’t, what a pity. My father is waiting for me at the bank to make a transaction.” It’s the second invitation for a cup of coffee she has turned down, but this time she said: “What a pity.” If she wouldn’t have said that, I think I would have either shattered a glass on the floor, bitten my lower lip, or driven my nails into my finger tips. But no, nonsense, that’s just not true; I wouldn’t have done anything.  At most, I was left discouraged and empty, with my legs crossed, grinding my teeth, and my eyes hurting from looking at the same cup of coffee for so long. But she said: “What a pity,” and still, before she left, she asked: “Are you always here, at this hour?” “Sure,” I replied, lying. “Then let’s postpone the invitation for another day.” “Well, don’t forget,” I stressed, and then she left. The waiter appeared about five minutes later with another cup of coffee and said, looking out into the street: “What lovely sunshine, huh? One feels renewed. Makes you want to sing and everything.” Only then did I hear myself. Unconsciously, like an old gramophone on which a record is placed and  forgotten, I had arrived, without realizing it, at the second stanza of “Mi Bandera.”
