			They’re green. Sometimes gray. I was looking at her, perhaps for too long, when she asked me: “What is it, sir?” It’s ridiculous for her to call me “sir.” “You have a smudge on your face,” I replied, like a coward. She wiped off her cheek with her index finger (one of her very characteristic gestures which stretches her eye downward and looks unattractive) and asked: “What about now?” “Now it looks impeccable,” I replied, with a little less cowardice. She blushed, and I was able to add: “Now you’re no longer impeccable, now you’re pretty.” I think she noticed. I think now she knows that something is happening. Or had she interpreted what I said as paternal flattery? It disgusts me to feel paternal.
