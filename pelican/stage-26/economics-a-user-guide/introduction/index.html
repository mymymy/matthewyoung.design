				<h3 >What is Economics?</h3>
				
					<p>A reader who is not familiar with the subject would think that it is the study of the economy. After all, chemistry is the study of chemicals, biology is the study of living things, and sociology is the study of society, so economics must be the study of the economy, the reader will reckon.</p>
	
					<p>Apparently not &ndash; at least according to some of the most popular economics books of our time. According to those books, economics is about the Ultimate Question &ndash; of &lsquo;Life, The Universe, and Everything&rsquo; &ndash; in <em>The Hitch-hiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, the cult comedy science-fiction series by Douglas Adams (I must confess I am a huge fan).</p>
	
					<p>Do you think I am joking? I am not &ndash; well, at least not entirely.</p>

					<p>According to Tim Harford, the <em>Financial Times</em> journalist of the <em>Undercover Economist</em> fame, economics is about Life &ndash; he has named his second book <em>The Logic of Life</em>.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>No economist has quite yet claimed that economics can explain the Universe. That would have been presumptuous. The Universe is the turf of physicists, who most economists have for centuries been looking up to as their role models, in their desire to make their subject a true &lsquo;science&rsquo;. But some economists have come close &ndash; they have claimed that economics is about &lsquo;the world&rsquo;. For example, the sub-title of the second volume in Robert Frank&rsquo;s popular <em>Economic Naturalist</em> series is <em>How Economics Helps You Make Sense of Your World</em>.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Then there is the &lsquo;everything&rsquo; bit. The sub-title of <em>Logic of Life</em> is <em>Uncovering the New Economics of Everything</em>. According to its sub-title, <em>Freakonomics</em> by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner &ndash; probably the best-known economics book of our time &ndash; is an exploration of the <em>Hidden Side of Everything</em>. Robert Frank agrees, even though he is somewhat more modest in his claim. In the sub-title of his first <em>Economic Naturalist</em> book, he only said <em>Why Economics Explains </em><strong><em>Almost</em></strong><em> Everything</em> [emphasis added]&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>So, there we go. Economics is (almost) about life, the universe, and everything. Incidentally, this should make economists&rsquo; life really easy, because we already know the answer to that Ultimate Question, that is, 42, but let&rsquo;s leave that aside for the matter.</p>

					<p>When you think about it, this is some claim coming from a subject that has spectacularly failed in what most non-economists think is its main job &ndash; that is, explaining the economy. The majority of the economics profession &ndash; having preached the world that markets are rarely wrong and that modern economics has found ways to iron out those few wrinkles that markets may have &ndash; was caught completely by surprise by the 2008 global financial crisis. Not only that, they have not been able to come up with decent solutions to the on-going aftermaths of the crisis. Given all this, economics seems to suffer from a serious case of megalomania &ndash; how can a subject that cannot even explain its own area very well claim to explain (almost) everything?</p>

				<h3 >Economics is the study of <br/>rational human choice &hellip;</h3>

					<p>You may think I am being unfair. Aren&rsquo;t all these books aimed for the mass market, where competition is fierce, and therefore bound to make hyped-up claims? Surely, you would think, the serious academic discourses would not make such a grand claim that the subject is about &lsquo;everything&rsquo;.</p>
	
					<p>It is true that these titles are hyped up, but the point is that they are hyped up in a particular way. The hypes could have been something along the line of &lsquo;how economics explains everything about the economy&rsquo;, but they are instead along the line of &lsquo;how economics can even explain not just the economy but everything else as well&rsquo;. Typical is the claim made in <em>Freakonomics </em>that economics &lsquo;represents the actual world&rsquo;, as opposed to an ideal world represented by morality (p. 190).</p>

					<p>The reason why the hypes are of this particular variety is because the way in which the dominant school of economics, that is, the so-called Neoclassical school, has defined economics. The Neoclassical school &ndash; which believes that every human behaviour is ultimately explainable through an analysis of rational choice by selfish individuals &ndash; has defined economics in terms of its analytical methodology, rather than the object of its analysis. &nbsp;</p>

					<p>The classic definition of the subject along this line is by one of the leading Neoclassical economists of mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, the British economist, Lionel Robbins (1898-1984). In his famous 1932 book, <em>An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science</em>, Robbins defined economics as &lsquo;the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In this view, economics is a study of <em>rational choice</em>, that is, choice made on the basis of deliberate, systematic calculation of the maximum extent to which the &lsquo;ends&rsquo; that can be met by using the available &lsquo;means&rsquo;. The subject matter of the calculation can be anything, and not just &lsquo;economic&rsquo; issues, as non-economists would define them &ndash; jobs, money, or prices.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Despite this definition, in the beginning, few economists ventured out of the traditional economic issues. However, starting with the Chicago University economist Gary Becker&rsquo;s work in the 1960s and the 1970s, summarised in the book, <em>The Economic Approach to Human Behaviour</em> (1976), the rational-choice approach started to be applied to non-economic areas, such as politics, marriage, child-rearing, and crime. This trend, called by its critics &lsquo;economics imperialism&rsquo;, has reached its apex recently in books like <em>Freakonomics</em>. Very little of <em>Freakonomics</em> is actually about economic issues in the conventional sense. It talks about Japanese sumo wrestlers, American schoolteachers, Chicago drug gangs, participants in the quiz show, <em>The Weakest Link</em>, real estate agents, and the Ku Klux Klan. Most people would think (and the authors also admit &ndash; <strong>give quote</strong>) that all of them, except real estate agents and drug gangs, are not even remotely related to economic issues in the usual sense.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>However, from the point of view of most economists today, how Japanese sumo wrestlers collude to help each other out or how American schoolteachers fabricate their pupils&rsquo; marks to get better job assessments are as legitimate subjects of economics as whether Greece should stay in the Eurozone, how Samsung and Apple fight it out in the smartphone market, or how we can reduce youth employment in Spain (which is around 50% at the time of writing &ndash; middle of 2012). To those economists, those &lsquo;economic&rsquo; issues do not have privileged status in economics &ndash; they are just some of many things (oh, I forgot, some of everything) that economics can explain, because they define their subject in terms of its theoretical approach, rather than its subject matter.</p>

				<h3 >&hellip; or is it the study of the economy?</h3>

					<p>An obvious alternative definition of economics, which I have been implying, is that it is the study of the economy. But what is the economy?</p>
	
					<p>The most intuitive answer to most readers may be that the economy is anything to do with <strong>money</strong> &ndash; not having it, earning it, spending it, running out of it, saving it, borrowing it, and repaying it. This is not quite right, but it is a good starting point for thinking about the economy &ndash; and economics.</p>

					<p>Now, when we talk about the economy being about money, we are of course not really talking about physical money. Physical money &ndash; be it a bank note, a gold coin, or the huge, virtually immovable stones that was used as money in some Pacific islands &ndash; is only a symbol. It is a symbol of what others in your society owe you, or your claim on particular amounts of the society&rsquo;s resources, as brilliantly explained by Felix Martin in his new book, <em>Money: An Unauthorised Biography</em>. How these financial claims are created, sold, and bought is obviously one huge area of economics, called financial economics. These days, given the dominance of the financial industry in many countries, a lot of people equate economics with financial economics, but it is actually only a small part of what economics is about.</p>

					<p>Your money &ndash; or the claims you have over resources &ndash; may be generated in a number of different ways. And a lot of economics is (or should be) about those.</p>

					<p>The most common way to get money &ndash; unless you have been born into &ndash; is to work in a job and earn it. So, a lot of economics is about <strong>jobs</strong>. But then we can talk about jobs at many different levels.</p>

					<p>First of all, there are jobs from a point of view of individual workers. Whether you get a job and how much you are paid for it depends on the skills (in the broad sense) you have and how much demand there are for them. You may get very high wages because you have unique skills; you may find it difficult to get a job because a lot of people happen to have the particular skills you have; or you may lose your job because someone invents a machine that can do what you do 100 times faster; or you have to accept lower wages because your company is losing money because of cheaper imports from, say, China; and so on. So, in order to understand jobs, we need to know about skills, technological innovation, and international trade.</p>

					<p>However, jobs are not just about individual workers or even the companies that hire them. They are also about the overall economic situation. Since the outbreak of the 2008 global financial crisis, tens of millions people have become unemployed <em>not</em> because their skills have suddenly become obsolete <em>but</em> because many companies went bankrupt and the surviving ones sacked their workers and stopped hiring new workers. And all that was because of the sudden, large fall in demand that these companies were facing, following the financial crisis. In this situation, different governments have tried to prop up demand and reduce unemployment by manipulating their taxes and spending, interest rates, or the quantity of money in circulation (this is these days known as &lsquo;quantitative easing&rsquo;). All of these are issues in &lsquo;macroeconomics&rsquo; &ndash; the economics of the entire economy, rather than its constituent parts.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Jobs are also about politics. Your wages and working conditions can be radically affected by &lsquo;political&rsquo; decisions to change the very scope and the characteristics of the labour market (I put &lsquo;political&rsquo; in quotation marks, as in the end the boundary between economics and politics is blurry, but that is a topic for later). For example, the accession of the Eastern European countries to the European Union have had huge impacts on the wages and behaviours of existing Western European workers, by suddenly and hugely expanding the boundary of their labour markets. In the past, the abolition of slavery had a similar effect &ndash; suddenly millions of additional workers (the emancipated slaves) were available in the labour market of Northern industrial states. The restriction on child labour in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and the early 20<sup>th</sup> century had the opposite effect of shrinking the boundary of the labour market &ndash; suddenly 20-30% of the potential employees were shut out of the labour market. These are the more dramatic examples, but even less dramatic &lsquo;political&rsquo; actions &ndash; for example, regulations on working hours, working conditions, and minimum wages &ndash; can have greater impacts on our wages and working conditions than macroeconomic policies, not to speak of what you can do as an individual worker (e.g., working extra hours, getting an extra skills certificate, etc.).</p>

					<p>In addition to holding down a job, you can get money through <strong>transfers</strong> &ndash; that is, by simply being given it. This can be either in the form of cash or &lsquo;in kind&rsquo;, that is, direct provision of particular goods (e.g., food) or services (e.g., primary education). Whether in cash or in kind, these transfers can be made in a number of different ways.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>First, there are transfers made by &lsquo;people you know&rsquo; &ndash; families, kin, and local communities. Examples include parental support for children, people taking care of elderly family members, gifts from local community members (probably for special occasions, like wedding). These transfers are not purely economic ones. That is, they are not just about money but there are issues of biological instincts, love, loyalty, tradition, and so on involved. However, they do have economic dimensions. For example, in many poor societies one (obviously not the only or not necessarily even the main) reason to have children and support them is to have economic supports in old ages, as there is no (or little) old age pension system. For another example, mutual supports within a community may be seen partly (but not entirely) as &lsquo;rational&rsquo; insurance schemes against hard times, even though that is not all that there is to it.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Second, there are transfers voluntarily made by &lsquo;strangers&rsquo;. People &ndash; sometimes individually sometimes collectively (e.g., through corporations, cooperatives, voluntary associations) &ndash; give to charities that help others. Charitable giving is an example of human behaviour that does not readily fit the Neoclassical economic theory, which is predicated on the assumption that people are selfish (and rational). If people are selfish, why do they give money to people, who have probably one in a billion chance to reciprocate? (I am excluding those obviously selfish &lsquo;charitable&rsquo; giving, such as donating money to think tanks that promote your kind of ideas). So, voluntary transfers to strangers (charitable giving) is an example (out of many) of why we cannot understand our economy with the standard assumption of &lsquo;rational selfish individual&rsquo;.</p>
	
					<p>In terms of its quantity, charitable giving is, of course, overshadowed in many multiples by <em>less voluntary</em> transfers through governments &ndash; administrated through various taxes and transfers. So a lot of economics is naturally about these things &ndash; or the areas of economics known as &lsquo;public economics&rsquo;. (Note that I am saying &lsquo;less voluntary&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;involuntary&rsquo; or &lsquo;compulsory&rsquo;, as many free-market economists would put it, because tax payments, while being compulsory, are ultimately dependent on some degree of consent by the taxpayers. The scrapping of the &lsquo;poll tax&rsquo; by the British government in 1990 due to public anger and riots is a good illustration of this point.)</p>

					<p>Even in very poor countries, there are some government schemes to give cash or goods in kind (e.g., free grains, food stamps) to those who cannot work (e.g., the aged, the disabled, or orphans) or to those who have fallen on hard times (e.g., public works for the poor, free food for the starving). But richer societies have transfer schemes that are much more comprehensive in scope and generous in amounts &ndash; commonly known as the welfare state.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Contrary to the common perception, the welfare state is not just about transfers &ndash; that is, taxing the richer groups in the society so that the government can give money to the poorer groups. Even though there are schemes that are pure transfers, like income supports for the poor (the vilified &lsquo;welfare mothers&rsquo; in the US) or the disabled, a lot of welfare schemes contain other aspects. For example, old age pensions include a large element of your own savings, while schemes to protect you from unemployment, industrial accident or health insurance are more of insurances than transfers. So, we cannot understand the welfare state simply by looking at taxes and transfers. We also need to understand the logic of savings and insurance, which are yet different areas of economics.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Now, even in countries with the largest welfare states, such as Sweden or Finland, not all transfers occur through the welfare state. Many governments may also make transfers by providing some &lsquo;basic&rsquo; or services (water, public transport, postal services) at below costs for the sake of &lsquo;fairness&rsquo;. The resulting losses for the firms that supply those services are made up by subsidies from the government. Since the richer groups in the society tend to pay larger share of their incomes as taxes (except for those super-rich that utilise tax havens) than do the poorer groups, this effectively means that they are subsidising the poorer groups, when it comes to the provision of those &lsquo;basic&rsquo; services. But this is not just a matter of government finance. Understanding these issues involve thinking about concepts like &lsquo;basic needs&rsquo; and &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; &ndash; which are very poorly developed in Neoclassical economics &ndash; as well as questions of ownership, as many of those suppliers are owned by the public (public enterprises) or by the consumers (cooperatives).</p>

					<p>Once you gain access to resources, whether through jobs or transfers and whether in money or in kind, you consume them. As physical beings, we need to consume food, clothes, energy, housing, and other physical <em>goods</em> to keep ourselves alive and, hopefully, physically comfortable. And then we consume other goods for &lsquo;higher&rsquo; mental wants &ndash; books, musical instruments, exercise equipment, TV, computers, and so on. We also may buy and consume <em>services</em>, such as bus ride, hairdressing, eating out, or foreign travel. So a lot of economics is devoted to the study of <strong>consumption</strong> &ndash; how people allocated the money they have between different types of goods and services, how they make choices between competing varieties of the same product, how they are manipulated and/or informed by advertisements, how companies spend money to build their &lsquo;brand images&rsquo;, and so on.</p>

					<p>In order to be consumed, these goods and services have to be produced in the first place &ndash; goods in farms and factories and services in offices and shops. This is the realm of <strong>production</strong> &ndash; an area of economics that is curiously under-appreciated by Neolcassical economists, despite its obvious importance.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>In standard economics textbooks, production appears as a &lsquo;black box&rsquo;, in which somehow labour and capital are combined to produce the goods and services. There is little recognition that production is a lot more than combining some abstract quanta called labour and capital and involves getting a lot of &lsquo;nitty-gritty&rsquo; things right. And these are often things that most readers may not normally have associated with economics &ndash; design of work flows (e.g., how to arrange the machines), control of the workers, relationships with trade unions, mechanisms to systematically improve the technologies used, and cooperation with other actors (e.g., supplier firms).&nbsp;</p>
	
					<p>Most economists are very happy to leave the study of these things to &lsquo;other people&rsquo; &ndash; engineers and business managers. And insofar as there are economists who study these things by visiting factories or talking to engineers, they are considered somehow less intelligent than those who do abstract modelling of, say, information transmission, those who try to establish statistical regularity between the nature of a country&rsquo;s legal system and its economic growth, those who study fluctuations in the financial market, or whatever &lsquo;normal&rsquo; economists do.</p>

					<p>However, when you think about it, production is the ultimate foundation of any economy. Unless we produce goods and services, nothing can happen in the economy &ndash; no jobs, no money, no taxes and transfers, and no consumption. The changes in the sphere of production are usually the most powerful sources of social change. As I shall show in the following chapters, what has made our modern world is the series of changes in technologies and institutions relating to the sphere of production that have been made since the Industrial Revolution. The economics profession, and the rest of us whose views of the economy are informed by it, needs to pay far more attention to production than it is doing now.</p>

				<div class="section-break"></div>

					<p>So, my view is that economics should be defined <em>not</em> in terms of its methodology, or theoretical approach, <em>but</em> in terms of its subject matter, as it is the case with all other subjects. The subject matter of economics should be the economy, rather than &ldquo;life, the universe and everything&rdquo; (or a bit more modestly &ldquo;almost everything&rdquo;), as many economists think these days.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>Defining economics in this way makes this book unlike most other economics books in one fundamental way.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>As they define economics in terms of its methodology, most economics books assume that there is only one right way of &lsquo;doing economics&rsquo; &ndash; that is, the so-called Neoclassical approach. The worst examples would not even tell you that there are other schools of thought in economics than Neoclassical school. But there are many different economic theories &ndash; Classical, Keynesian, Marxist, Schumpeterian, Austrian, Behaviouralist, Institutionalist, Structuralist, to name just a few (I will explain what they are later).&nbsp;</p>

					<p>By defining economics in terms of the subject matter, this book highlights the fact that there are many different ways of doing economics</span> and that different approaches have different strengths and weaknesses. After all, what we want from economics is the best possible explanation of certain economic phenomena rather than a constant &lsquo;proof&rsquo; that a particular economic theory can explain not just economics but &lsquo;everything&rsquo;.</p>
