	<p><span class="fig">Fig. 01</span> <em>The Blue Marble</em>, taken by Jack Schmitt, 1972</p>
</div>

<p>In 1972, the astronaut Jack Schmitt took a picture of Earth from the Apollo 17 spacecraft, now believed to be the most reproduced photograph ever. Many felt that seeing this photograph changed their lives. It shows the spherical globe dominated by blue oceans with intervening green landmasses and swirling clouds. As a result, it came to be known as &ldquo;Blue Marble.&rdquo; From space, you could not make out human activity or presence. The photograph powerfully visualized the planet as a whole. People found spiritual and environmental lessons in this seeing of the planet as if from the place of a god. They talked about a world government, perhaps even a single global language. Above all, it seemed to show that the world was a single, unified place. Today, that unified world, visible from one spot, seems out of reach. We are confronted with multiple worlds: the world at war, the financial world, the media world, a changing natural world, the art world, a world under surveillance,global social movements, unknowable worlds of tiny viruses and huge forces that we cannot see at all. Seeing the world now involves being in many places at once and doing different kinds of looking at different sets of events.These worlds don&rsquo;t add up. What we call multi-tasking is moving from one world to the next, checking where they intersect, and deciding what we can safely ignore. It&rsquo;s hard. That's why we have to think about how to see the world.</p>
<p>At first, you may feel that this is not right because it goes against much that we take for granted. Of course, the planet is still one physical entity. But that doesn't really help. The Greek philosopher Archimedes declared &ldquo;Give me a fulcrum and I can move the world.&rdquo; The point was precisely that there is no such fulcrum. In the same way, we know that all the world's activities interconnect. We just can't see them all from the same place at the same time. These are complex, interactive systems. We might imagine them as detailed layers in a video game. Each layer appears to be the game in itself, until we realize that the game has multiple layers. Some have detailed interfaces, some are barely connected. Some of these interfaces are visualized, especially on screens. Some take place invisibly and may even be carried out by machines. Each layer gives the illusion of being organized from some central place but itis not. The most striking reveal of this mirage came with the 2008 financial crash. What we had been told was the perfectly calculated globalized financial market collapsed without warning. It turned out that the system was so finely leveraged that a relatively small number of people, who were unable to keep up with their mortgages, set in motion a rolling catastrophe. Or to take another example, if you need to move country for personal or political reasons, it's very difficult. You have to work out what's legally and financially possible, often in a foreign language. &nbsp;Money, on the other hand, can move wherever it wants at the click of a keyboard. There's globalization in theory, which is smooth and easy. And there's the uneven, difficult and time-consuming experience of globalization in practice. The ads and the politicians tell us it&rsquo;s one world now. Our daily lives tell us otherwise: it isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h3>To See the World</h3>
<p>Let's look at the 1972 &ldquo;Blue Marble&rdquo; photograph again. As much as people who saw it felt they had seen the planet, of course they had not. They had looked at a mass-reproduced photograph, whether in a newspaper, magazine or on television (in those pre-Internet days). In order to make sense of what they were seeing, people had to be familiar with the century-old conventions of photography. When the medium was first invented in Britain and France in 1839, many were nervous of it. The novelist Honor&eacute; de Balzac, famous for his descriptions of modern Paris, refused to have his picture taken, claiming that it would strip away a layer of his soul. Such ideas were later attributed to so-called primitive peoples and this story shows that we are all primitive when confronted with radically new technology. Of course, by the 1970s such fears had long been forgotten but photographs remained powerful influences on our lives. When people have to claim something from a damaged building, it&rsquo;s always the photographs that they want. The photographic view from space was new and allowed us to imagine ourselves in different ways. As soon as the first blurry view of earth from above the atmosphere had been taken by V-2 rockets in the 1940s. journalists had predicted the rise of civilian and military surveillance. In 1968, the Apollo 8 mission that orbited the moon brought back a photograph of the earth from the moon. Known as &ldquo;Earthrise,&rdquo; this picture showed half the globe emerging from the night, above a lunar landscape. Technically, the astronauts were breaking mission regulations by even taking the picture. In a measure of how fast things have changed since then, this picture was taken on Christmas Eve 1968 but was not developed until January 10, 1969. By 1972 even the idea of seeing the planet from space had become familiar.</span><span></span></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Blue Marble&rdquo; picture worked so well because it captured the idea of &ldquo;one world&rdquo; by means of what photographers call composition. Every photograph creates meaning in part by the way it selects what to look at and what to leave out. Sometimes this is political, as in the instances where Soviet leaders would be airbrushed out of past photographs when they fell from favor. Sometimes it is aesthetic, so that a close-up of a person&rsquo;s face gives us a different sense of them than a shot of their whole body. Sometimes it&rsquo;s dictated by the camera itself, which has a limited range of settings. In the case of &ldquo;Blue Marble,&rdquo; the Earth is seen very close to the edge of the frame. It dominates the picture space and overwhelms our senses. It seems both immense and knowable at once. Trained by maps to recognize the outline of the continents, viewers could now see how this apparently abstract space was a lived and living whole. The photograph mixed the known and the new in a visual format that made it comprehensible and beautiful at once.</span><span></span></p>
<p>Another way to show the planet would be to highlight how it is surrounded by vast expanses of empty space, as in the photograph below taken from Mars by the Mars Orbiter Camera in 2003.</span><span></span></p>

<p>In this photograph, Earth and Jupiter are aligned, a rare astronomical event. The main impact for the non-scientific viewer, however, is a powerful sense of the insignificance of our planet in the immensity of the cosmos. To many of us, it will seem obvious that &ldquo;Blue Marble&rdquo; is the better photograph. That is the measure of the success of photographers over the past 150 years in convincing us that photography is mostly about beauty and visual appeal. At first, people assumed that the new image-making technology was best suited for scientific purposes and portraits of people. So while the photograph from Mars is technically far more of an achievement, most people are not now appreciative of that skill. In order to be visible at all, the photo had to be adjusted to make the two planets more clearly visible to the naked eye, a complex process described on the mission website:</span><span></span></p>
<p>Because Jupiter is over 5 times farther from the Sun than Earth, two different exposures were needed to image the two planets. Mosaiced together, the images are shown above. The composite has been highly contrast-enhanced and "colorized" to show both planets and their satellites. The MGS MOC high resolution camera only takes grayscale (black-and-white) images; the color was derived from Mariner 10 and Cassini pictures of Earth/Moon and Jupiter, respectively.</span><span></span></p>
<p>In short, what we can &ldquo;see&rdquo; in the image, we could never see with our own eyes. It is a way to see the world enabled by satellites, machine inter-planetary travel, visual technologies and computer graphics. If &ldquo;Blue Marble&rdquo; was manipulated in the dark room, it was no more than the standard manipulation of all photographic processing in which the negative is changed to a positive. So we have the illusion that if we had been there, we could have taken this picture. Satellites had been taking similar pictures since 1967, such as the color-corrected image below, taken in November 1967 by the ATS III satellite, which bears a notable resemblance to &ldquo;Blue Marble.&rdquo;</span><span></span></p>

<div class="illustration">
	<img src="satellite-1967.jpg" />
	<p><span class="fig">Fig. 02</span> ATS III Satellite, November 1967</p>
</div>

<p>It was the fact that a person had been there and taken the picture that made &ldquo;Blue Marble&rdquo; so powerful. Schmitt was using a 70 millimetre Hasselblad camera with an 80 millimetre lens, whose equivalent today costs over $30,000, so his photograph was not exactly a point-and-shoot. It so unites the knowledge of maps, the training in how to see photographs and the belief in a global unity that this photograph jumped out of all such limitations and became an instant classic. </span><span></span></p>

<h3>Sight and Vision</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s develop this a bit further. We think of seeing as a natural process. But when we test someone&rsquo;s eyesight, we ask them to read a chart of letters, an entirely abstract and culturally determined accomplishment. I can see a Chinese character but I have no idea what it means or how to distinguish it from similar characters. Similarly, a Chinese speaker might struggle to separate 'e' from 'c' or 'a' that seem &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; different to those familiar with the Roman alphabet. It is certainly true that for the sighted, the eyes function without a conscious choice to use them. How what is seen is interpreted is another matter altogether. We can distinguish between biological sight, which sees what there is to see, and cultural vision, which makes sense of it all. This distinction is so well accepted that there are advertising campaigns based on different interpretations of the same sight. HSBC bank, for example, created a 2005 series of ads that are still running today around the theme: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it better to be open to other people&rsquo;s point of view?&rdquo;</span><span></span></p>

<div class="illustration">
	<img src="trendy-traditional.jpg" />
	<p><span class="fig">Fig. 03</span> Isn't it better to be open to other people's point of view? HSBC, 2005</p>
</div>

<p>In this example, tattooing is shown using two captions &ldquo;trendy&rdquo; and &ldquo;traditional.&rdquo; The message is complicated by the use of clearly demarcated ethnic types. So a man of African descent is used juxtaposed to a light-skinned woman. The opposition is then between Africa as &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; or &ldquo;trendy,&rdquo; suggesting that the decoration is either a long-established African religion or simply personal style. In the case of the woman, it is less clear what &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; would mean: as the decoration seems to be henna, rather than a permanent tattoo, perhaps she is supposed to be Indian. &ldquo;Trendy&rdquo; fits her better, as her markings will disappear and can be replaced by others. What, however, have we learned about HSBC banking from the contrasts here? It&rsquo;s designed to suggest that the bank is at home in a globalized culture and open to all points of view. In late 2012, HSBC paid U.S. authorities $1.92 billion to settle allegations of money laundering for such entities as Mexican drug cartels and the government of Iran, precisely at the time these ads were current. Perhaps unsurprisingly, their ads have now changed to avoid suggestions that working for criminals might be going a tad too far in seeing the other point of view.</span><span></span></p>
<p>Even the way we learn from what we can see and what we can say about it has changed. There&rsquo;s a famous psychology video test, devised by Daniel Simons and his student Christopher Chabris in the late 1990's, known as the &ldquo;Invisible Gorilla.&rdquo; It asks those taking it to count the number of times the team wearing white passes a basketball in a video showing them playing a team wearing black shirts. As this simple action unfolds, a person wearing a gorilla suit walks across the court. </span><span></span></p>

<div class="illustration">
	<iframe width="720" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IGQmdoK_ZfY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>The point of the video was that half of the people watching did not even notice the gorilla. They were concentrating on counting. This results in &ldquo;inattentional blindness,&rdquo; the inability to perceive outside information when concentrating on a task. Researchers had been aware of this phenomenon since the 1970s, as had magicians from time immemorial&mdash;&ldquo;the sleight of the hand deceives the eye&rdquo; because the magician distracts your attention. It was the video that made the test so dramatic. You could test yourself and then watch the video again to see how obvious the gorilla then appears. I have seen people get very upset when they realize their failure. In their book on the subject, Simons and Chabris claim&nbsp;"your brain can be activated by images that only vaguely resemble what they're tuned for." This argument follows the research of neuroscientists like Humberto Maturana from the 1970s. Maturana demonstrated that a frog, for example, sees very differently than we do. It perceives small, fast-moving objects like the insects it eats very clearly, while ignoring large slow-moving things. That does not mean that the elephant that steps on the frog does not exist, just that the frog is not best equipped to see it. Birds can perceive ultra-violet light invisible to humans and so their own plumage looks very different to each other than it does to us. However, this&nbsp;seeing is not vision in itself. Maturana stresses that living things change themselves&nbsp;because of their awareness of their interactions with the outside world, not just in the very long run described by evolution, but as a condition of day-to-day existence.</span><span></span></p>
<p>That is exactly what has happened in response to new media.&nbsp;When I show the gorilla test video to students and others today, nearly everyone does see it. Simons himself has shown that when you show the video to experienced basketball players, the number seeing the gorilla jumps to about 70%. Simons&rsquo;s recent study demonstrating that some people continue not to see the gorilla was based on a small sample of 64 people. Of these only 41 were unaware of his video. In this group, 18 did not see the gorilla, well under 50%. My sample group is larger in size, and compiled over several years, although not conducted as a scientific study. Some people had also seen the video before but most had not. Perhaps my counter sample, drawn as it is from participants in visual culture classes, is more visually aware. Or perhaps a result that does not exceed 50% of those tested is indicative only of a tendency rather than a hard and fast rule. It is clear that the human body cannot have evolved in such a short space of time. The difference is more likely to be in the way we make use of it. In a period of industrial work, concentrating on a specific activity and ignoring distractions was highly desirable. From the academic research by a student in a library to the adjustment of a machine by a factory worker, attention needed to be focused. Today, we prioritize the ability to keep in touch with multiple channels of information. As I write, people are sending me emails and text messages to which they expect prompt replies, regardless of what I am doing. That is to say, we were formerly trained not to see the gorilla and mostly, though not exclusively, we did not. Now are trained to pay attention to distractions and mostly, though not exclusively, we do.</span><span></span></p>
<p>I recently participated in a durational performance by the artist Regina Galindo in Brazil, where the artist posed naked outdoors painted black. Her piece was designed to raise our awareness of the passing of time. As she had formed a shape with her body that concealed her eyes, she would not have been able to see that all around her, the audience was busy on their phones, texting, posting statuses, taking photographs and the like. No one perceived a contradiction. Trained by video games to watch across the whole screen, young people are especially aware of such distractions. A widely-cited 2006 study from the University of Rochester showed that playing video games improved both peripheral and central visual perception. There are many reports of improved hand-eye co-ordination. In 2010 another Rochester study showed that gamers make faster and more accurate decisions based on sensory perceptions. Lead author Daphne Bavelier describes this as &ldquo;probablistic inference,&rdquo; meaning the kinds of decisions we make based on incomplete information, such as choices made while driving. No one is suggesting, however, that we turn over all decision-making to video game players. The point is that there are different forms of visual perception and that certain forms of training can improve them. Furthermore, these can change quickly as a result of changed needs. In 1990, no one was playing high-speed full motion capture video games. Twenty years later, such games are being suggested as a model for higher education. We should be careful not to turn these perceptual tricks into universal explanations. Simons and Chabris suggest that President George W. Bush&rsquo;s claim to have seen the first plane fly into the World Trade Center on 9-11 was a form of inattentional blindness. It seems more likely that it was a conscious or unconscious attempt to distract our attention from the unfortunate video showing the President reading </span><span>The Pet Goat</span><span> to schoolchildren and the subsequent allegation that he was holding the book upside down. Try and track down what happened on the Internet and you enter a swirl of rumor and counter-rumor. One set of websites alleges the photographs of Bush with the upside-down book are fakes, another that they are not, still a third that they are evidence of satanic rituals. Each variant claims to be able to show that their rivals have been digitally manipulating photographs and videos. It feels like we&rsquo;re disappearing down a rabbit-hole .</span><span></span></p>

<h3>Visualizing</h3>
<p>If we compare the world forty years ago to today, one of the most noticeable differences is the remarkable increase in visual technologies and the spread of visual images. There have been many similar periods of dramatic change in the visible world before. The nineteenth century was famously described by the historian Jean-Louis Commolli as a &ldquo;frenzy of the visible&rdquo; because of the invention of photography, film, X-rays and many other now forgotten visual technologies in the period. Europeans considered the development of maps, microscopes, telescopes and other devices made the seventeenth century an era of visual discovery. And so we could continue back to the first cosmographic representation of the world on a clay tablet from 2500 BCE. But the transformation of the visual image since the rise of personal computing and the Internet is different in terms of sheer quantity, geographic extent and its convergence on the digital. The quantity of imagery is breathtaking. Every two minutes, Americans alone take more photographs than were made in the entire nineteenth century. YouTube was founded in 2005. In 2013, the company claimed:</span><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Over 800 million unique users visit YouTube each month</li>
<li>Over 4 billion hours of video are watched each month on YouTube</li>
<li>72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute</li>
<li>70% of YouTube traffic comes from outside the US</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2011, there were one trillion visits to YouTube. The first available video cameras for personal use appeared in 1985. They were heavy, shoulder-borne devices and not well-suited for casual use. It was not until the invention of digital videotape in 1995 that home video became a practical possibility. Editing was still an expensive proposition until the introduction of programs like Apple&rsquo;s iMovie in 2000. Seen in a longer historical perspective, this is an extraordinary pace of change. The first moving images were recorded by the Lumi&egrave;re brothers in France in 1895. A little more than a century later and the moving image has become astonishingly widespread and easily available. By contrast, consider the portrait. For centuries, these were the preserve of kings and nobles, whether in painting or sculpture. The development of oil painting on transportable canvas in the fifteenth century made portraiture available to those who could afford it, like the elite merchant class. It was not until the invention of cheap photographic processes like the ambrotype or the carte-de-visite in the 1850s that portraits became very widely available. Louis Picquet, who was born into slavery, recalled in her autobiography being sent an ambrotype by her mother who was still enslaved just before the Civil War. There were 3.5 trillion photographs in existence in 2011 and more are being made every second. The portrait photo has reached almost every corner of the planet. The photographer Fazal Sheik has taken a moving set of pictures of the hands of refugees holding small portrait photographs in locations such as Afghanistan, where you might not expect visual imagery to be such a priority. </span><span></span></p>
<p>Above and beyond personal possession, far more people can see and share all this material via the Internet, the first truly global medium. 2.5 billion people had online access as of June 2012, and 45% of those people live in Asia. More people do have access to television but hardly anyone has influence as to what is shown on television and fewer still can place their own work on TV. The closer parallel is with books. In 2011, according to UNESCO, there were over 2,200,000 books published. The last European who was thought to have read all available printed books was the sixteenth-century reformer Erasmus (1466-1536). Libraries of all kinds contain far more material than any individual could possibly read. So we have long divided knowledge into many separate areas without any resulting disasters. The difference comes in the ways knowledge is made and circulated. While book publishing was traditionally open only to authors who could convince editors to produce their work, the Internet allows everyone with a connection to have a say. Over the long lifetime of print, many other means of getting published had emerged from the letter to the editor to self-produced pamphlets and photocopied documents. The transformation with visual images, especially moving images, has been faster and more extensive. </span><span></span></p>
<p>The most interesting questions resulting from this immense new archive are:</span><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>How is it possible?</li>
<li>What should we call these materials?</li>
<li>What does it mean?</li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;how&rdquo; question is simple enough on its face but it implies a transformation in the way visual materials should be understood. Which means we have to change the name we use for them. And how we think about what it is that they do.The transformation at hand is not simply one of quantity but of kind. All the &ldquo;images,&rdquo; whether moving or still, that appear in the new archives are formats of digital information. Although a modern camera still makes a shutter sound when you press the button, the mirror that used to moved, making that noise, is no longer there. The digital photograph references the analog without being the same. Like their analogue counterparts, digital media can be manipulated, whether by editing or darkroom-derved techniques. It's just much easier and faster, especially now that programs like Instagram will create effects at a single click without the user having to do anything other than choose which one they like. Early in the digital era, there was a panic that we would not be able to tell whether images had been manipulated or not. It turns out that at both amateur and professional level, it's not that hard. For example, magazine readers assume that all photographs of models and celebrities have been adjusted. They operate a flexible zone of acceptability, so that a photo can be altered but not so much that it's absurd. At the technical level, a skilled user can tell not only if an image has been manipulated but how and with what program. In early 2013 a star college football player named Manti Te'o was discovered to have created a story regarding the death of a fake girlfriend to gain sympathy and attention. Once websites were alerted to this possibility, it took less than 24 hours for them to reverse research the photograph he had circulated and discover it was not the woman he claimed.</span><span></span></p>
<p>It's common now to speak about digital images and imaging, which are similarly concepts transferred from an earlier era. At the time of the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the art historian John Berger made a classic television series and an accompanying book for the BBC called&nbsp;</span><span>Ways of Seeing&nbsp;</span><span>that put the concept of the image into popular circulation.&nbsp;He defined the image as &ldquo;a sight which has been recreated or reproduced.&rdquo; He flattened the hierarchy of the arts by making a painting or sculpture equivalent in this sense to a photograph or an advertisement.&nbsp;Berger was himself taking a cue from the German critic Walter Benjamin whose famous 1936 essay &ldquo;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&rdquo; had just been translated&nbsp;into English in 1968. Benjamin argued that photography destroyed the idea of the unique image because (at least in theory) infinite and identical copies of any photograph could now be made and distributed. By 1936, this was already old news, because photography was almost a century old. However, the new techniques for mass reproduction of high quality photographs in magazines and books, as well as the rise of the &ldquo;talkies,&rdquo; or films with sound, convinced Benjamin that a new era was at hand.</span><span></span></p>
<p>In our own time, the situation is different. Precisely because there are so many digital images, it's hard for any individual image to get attention or have an effect by itself. The most notorious example of this effect was the Abu Ghraib photographs that were revealed in 2004 during the war in Iraq. They showed U.S. troops subjecting Iraqi prisoners to bizarre humiliations and punishments, such as men having to wear women's&nbsp;underwear, form a human pyramid while naked, or perform sex acts on each other. Other images showed prisoners being dragged by a leash around the neck like a dog, covered in excrement, or standing on a box, arms extended, wearing a hood that resembled those used by the Ku Klux Klan. For all the real outrage and horror, especially in the Middle East, the material consequences of the scandal were few. No-one outside the prison was disciplined in any way. In the U.S. Presidential elections of that year, the photographs were never an issue.</span><span></span></p>
<p>In the digital era, the images that create change are memes. A meme is an idea or behavior that spreads from person to person without the intervention of a government or corporation but because people like it. Sometimes, this is known as &ldquo;going viral&rdquo; but the metaphor is not accurate. We have no choice as to whether to catch a virus but it's up to us whether to adopt a meme, such as Internet cats, Gangnam style, or phrases like &ldquo;I can haz cheezburger.&rdquo; Spread by heavy Internet users on sites like 4Chan, such memes appear to the uninitiated as if from nowhere and can disappear just as quickly. In the age of the image, the key action was copying. In the era of the meme, the key action is forwarding. To forward is a form of copying. However, as dramatized in the horror movie&nbsp;</span><span>The Ring</span><span>, what the meme itself wants (so to speak) is to continue to circulate and be seen by others.&nbsp;A clear distinction with the concept of the image is that the meme is not going to last anything like as long. Berger could discuss a 1936 essay in a book published in 1972 that continues to be taught today. In the digital era, redundancy is built-in, so that files generated by older software are illegible to present-day machines. The sheer speed of the medium that allows for an object to go from its maker to millions in seconds further&nbsp;accelerates this process.&nbsp;Before we know it, the meme itself will seem like an outdated concept, like the floppy disk, once central but now just a curiosity.</span><span></span></p>
<p>So we need a word to describe all this activity that has been around for a while, has demonstrated its continuing importance today and yet still has potential to develop. The word I'm going to use&nbsp;is visualizing, together with its related terms. It might sound like a new-age technique for self-actualization. People are often advised to visualize difficult situations, ranging from making a tricky shot in golf to negotiating a deal. It is in fact a much older process from an entirely different context, one that has been so well learned that it now appears normal, even natural. It was developed as a military tactic in eighteenth-century Europe when battlefields became too large for any one person to see. From this point on, the general was stationed behind the conflict from where he visualized what to do, using what others could see, the information he had available, his insight and intuition. Despite the name, then, visualizing is a mental process, not one of seeing at all. It involves what we sometimes call the mind&rsquo;s eye, a means of mentally capturing in one imagined frame a widespread situation. The French general Napoleon was widely held to be the best visualizer and he would deceive his opponents by sending troops where he knew they would be seen. His enemy would conclude that this was where Napoleon was making his main attack and would move troops accordingly, leaving them vulnerable to his surprise attacks from different positions. </span><span></span></p>
<p>Visualizing conflict continues to be a key military tactic, especially in the era of satellite surveillance and drone warfare. In the Field Manual 3-24&nbsp;</span><span>Counterinsurgency</span><span>, published in 2006 at the height of the Iraqi insurgency, the U. S. Army and Marine Corps defined counterinsurgency as depending above all on what they called &ldquo;command visualization.&rdquo;&nbsp;This visualizing involves knowing the Area of Operations so well that you know the local history, who has disputes with whom over what, how the fields and streets are laid out and so on. The commander should visualize how to deal with the economic and cultural needs of the local population, as well as how to fend off the insurgents. It can be described as a total management of a locality. The Army call it Full Spectrum Dominance.</span><span></span></p>
<p>Visualizing takes place in the mind. That&rsquo;s not to say that we don&rsquo;t make visualizations in material form to help us in that work. Napoleon used to have battlefield maps drawn after his conflicts, drawn from exactly the place he was standing. In this way, he could check back and compare how he had visualized the battle with what actually happened. For such purposes maps, plans, flow charts, diagrams, photographs of terrain, localities and individuals can all be very useful. Here we can begin to see how we can start to make some distinctions in the vast range of visual materials that have been created in the modern period. Some specifically attempt to visualize the world around them. Others explicitly do not. For example, the type of art that is produced under the mantra &ldquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; is not likely to be a visualization of anything other than the artist&rsquo;s imagination. That may be precisely why we like it but it does not lend itself to the type of visualizing that is intended to be of practical use.</span><span></span></p>
<p>For visualization techniques go beyond the practice of war to the full extent of leadership. Here again, this is derived from a long historical tradition. In 1840, the Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle generalized, as it were, the idea of visualizing to apply to History itself (Carlyle like to capitalize his words). For Carlyle, the great man was he (always) who could visualize history as it was happening and should therefore be the unquestioned leader. This concept of visuality, as he called it, was remarkably influential in the age of empire and later of dictatorship. Indeed, his phrase &ldquo;great men make history&rdquo; is still well-used, directly or indirectly. In this idea lies the entire theory of visualizing. We see its influence from the piles of long biographies in bookstores to vital role of debates in Presidential elections. More subtly, we see how the idea of the great leader as a visualizer has led to the words &ldquo;vision&rdquo; and &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; being practically synonymous. Imagine if a leader had to be a great listener. So visualizing turns out to be a fundamental means of organizing society. It is top-down, hierarchical, and prizes order above all else. Carlyle imagined that the Hero, or great man, could visualize past, present and future at once. </span><span></span></p>
<p>European colonial administrators and missionaries took copies of his book&nbsp;</span><span>On Heroes and Hero-Worship</span><span>&nbsp;(1840), in which he set out these ideas, to their posts. If you visit a town like Shimla in India you can see why the idea appealed. Shimla is a hill town within sight of the Himalayas. Although it was over a thousand miles from Calcutta, the administrative center of British India from 1857-1947, administrators moved there from March to October to avoid the heat of the plains. So from this tiny, remote location the Viceroy of India and his staff held sway over one-fifth of the world's population. They had information from the telegraph and later the telephone. But to reach Shimla in person was first a long trek uphill and later a slow train ride. Even today, it takes four hours to drive from the plain to the city. To run the empire&nbsp;from up here, the colonists had to believe themselves to be special, heroes of the imperial mission, while using the idea of visualization as a practical technology to imagine their immense tasks to themselves. It was not for nothing that the maneuvers in Central Asia in the region of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern India that are still central to global geo-politics today were known as the Great Game. It was as if the colonial leader was a player in a massive game, which only he could properly understand.</span><span></span></p>
<p>Since 1945, the world&rsquo;s great empires have dissolved. Britain left India in 1947. Beginning with Libya in 1951 and Egypt in 1952, Africa gained full independence with the end of the apartheid laws in South Africa in 1990 and Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s election in 1994. The Soviet Union disappeared in 1991. Whereas 85% of the world was part of an empire in 1914, a century later the United Nations suggests that there are 16 non-self governing territories around the world, home to some two million people. Since 1945, 80 former colonies with a total population of over 750 million have gained independence. Such figures do not include controversial cases like Tibet or Puerto Rico but nonetheless it is clear that the past century has led to a transformation. There are multiple world views today because there are so many more players on the world stage. This increase operates both at the level of the nation-state and individual people. For just as the colonial world-view did not allow the colonized nation to visualize itself, nor did it allow those who were not &ldquo;great men&rdquo; to do so. For much of the intervening period, debate has centered on whether or not particular forms of entertainment from comic books to action movies and video games are harmful. For example, does the visualization of violence cause actual violence or deter it? The digital revolution has not just allowed far more visualizations to circulate more freely than in the past. It has transformed many from people to whom things are shown to those who visualize for themselves. Where does all this lead? It&rsquo;s too early to tell. When the printing press was invented, it was not possible to imagine from the first publications how mass literacy would change the world. In the past century, visualizing has moved from being the preserve of a few to the practice of hundreds of millions. It&rsquo;s confusing, anarchic, liberating and worrying all at once. In the chapters that follow, </span><span>How To See The World</span><span> will suggest some ways we can organize and separate all of this. We&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s on the rise, what&rsquo;s falling back and what&rsquo;s being strongly contested. Unlike the Apollo astronauts, we&rsquo;ll have our feet firmly on the ground. But there&rsquo;s more to see than they could have imagined.</span><span></span></p>
