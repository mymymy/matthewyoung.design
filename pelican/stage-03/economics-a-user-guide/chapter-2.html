		<h1>How have we got here?</span></h1>
		
		<h2>A brief history of capitalism (and an even more brief history of socialism)</h2>
		
	<div id="line-break"></div>

<p>In this chapter, we discuss in greater detail how we have journeyed from Adam Smith&rsquo;s world of anonymous pin-making factories, child labour, debtors&rsquo; prisons, and gold coins to our world of Toyotas, limited liability companies, PIN-numbered credit cards, and mobile phone banking.</p>
<p>But why bother with history? Do we really need to know what happened before in order to know that free trade promotes economic growth, that high taxes discourage wealth creation, or that cutting red tapes encourage business activities? Aren&rsquo;t these and other economic wisdoms of our time all propositions derived from logically airtight theories and checked against a vast amount of contemporary statistical evidence?</p>
<p>Indeed, many economists these days believe that economic history is not very relevant to economics. Among the more theoretically-oriented economists, there is even a tendency to consider economic history at best as a harmless distraction, like train-spotting, and at worst as a refuge of the intellectually-challenged, who cannot handle &lsquo;hard&rsquo; stuff, like mathematics and statistics (some economic historians do use statistics, but their exercise is considered rather dubious, given the well-known quality problems with historical data).</p>
<p>However, I choose to present my readers with a brief history of capitalism before we proceed to more topical issues, because I believe that having some knowledge of that history is not only helpful but also necessary, if we are to fully understand economic phenomena. This is for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First, history affects the present and therefore we can only understand the present and predict the future only if we know our history well (well, reasonably well). This is an obvious, if still an extremely important, point, so I won&rsquo;t bore the reader with examples (which I will constantly do in the following).</p>
<p>Second, history &ndash; or, rather, what people think they know about history &ndash; affects the present (and the future) by informing people&rsquo;s decisions. Despite the pretence that economists do not need to know anything about history in order to make the right policy recommendations, a lot of actual policy recommendations are backed up by historical examples. This is because there is nothing like spectacular real-life cases &ndash; successful or otherwise &ndash; in persuading the others of the wisdom of your policy recommendations. So, for example, those who want to promote free trade frequently point out that Britain and then the US became the world&rsquo;s economic superpowers because they used free trade. If they realised that their version of the US history was incorrect (as I will show below), the promoters of free trade may not have such conviction in their policy and would find it harder to persuade the others.</p>
<p>Third, history lets us ditch some taken-for-grated assumptions. For example, once you know that lots of things that cannot be bought and sold today &ndash; human beings (slaves), labour service of children, government offices &ndash; used to be perfectly marketable, you will stop thinking that the boundary of the &lsquo;free market&rsquo; is drawn by some timeless law of science and accept that it can be re-drawan. For another example, if you learnt that the advanced capitalist economies grew the fastest in history between the 1950s and the 1970s, when there were a lot of (and increasing) regulations and high taxes, you will immediately become sceptical with the current British coalition government argument that all the core of any &lsquo;growth strategy&rsquo; should be tax cuts and &lsquo;cutting red-tapes&rsquo; (that is, abolishing or weakening regulations).</p>
<p>Fourth, history is also useful in making you see the limits of economic theory. As I like to say, life is often stranger than fiction, and history has given us so many successful economic experiences (at all levels &ndash; nations, companies, individuals) that cannot be explained very well by any single economic theory. For example, if you only read things like <em>The Economist </em>or<em> The Wall Street Journal</em>, you would only hear about Singapore&rsquo;s free trade policy and its welcoming attitudes towards foreign investment. This may make you conclude that Singapore proves how free trade and free market are the best for economic development &ndash; that is until you also learn that all the land in Singapore is owned by the government, 85% of housing is supplied by the government-owned housing corporation, and 22% of national output is produced by state-owned enterprises (the international average is around 10%). Once you realise that the history of Singapore does not neatly fit into any single economic theory &ndash; free-market, communist, Keynesian, you name it &ndash; you will be both more sceptical about the power of economic theory and also more cautious in drawing policy conclusions from it.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we need to look at history because we have the moral duty to avoid &lsquo;live experiments&rsquo; with people as much as possible. From the central planning in the former socialist bloc (and their &lsquo;Big Bang&rsquo; transition back to capitalism), through to the disasters of austerity policies following the Great Depression, down to the failures of &lsquo;trickle down economics&rsquo; in the US and the UK during the 1980s and the 1990s, history is littered with radical policy experiments that have destroyed the lives of millions, or even tens of millions, of people. Even though studying history won&rsquo;t allow you to completely avoid making mistakes in the present (things change all the time), we should do our best to extract lessons from history before we formulate a policy that will affect the lives of many, many people.</p>
<p>So, studying the history of capitalism is not just out of idle curiosity. It is necessary for us to better understand what is going on, it lets us spot theories based on &lsquo;historical facts&rsquo; that are not true, it is useful in making us question some standard assumptions, it helps us see the limits of economic theory, and it forces us to be more careful in implementing policies.</p>
<p>If you have been persuaded by any of the above points, let me take you through a (relatively) brief history of capitalism (and socialism), in which a lot of the historical &lsquo;facts&rsquo; that you know will be challenged and the way you understand capitalism (hopefully) transformed at least a little bit.</p>

<h3>Before Capitalism: Tortoise vs. Snails</h3>
<p>Capitalism started in Western Europe, especially in Britain and the Low Countries (mostly what are Belgium and the Netherlands today) around the 16<sup>th</sup> and the 17<sup>th</sup> centuries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why it started there &ndash; rather than, say China or India, which used to be comparable to Western Europe in their levels of economic development until then &ndash; is a subject of an intense and long-running debate. Everything from the Chinese elite&rsquo;s disdain for practical pursuits (like commerce and industry) to the discovery of the Americas and the pattern of Britain&rsquo;s coal deposits has been identified as the explanation. However, this debate need not detain us here, as the matter of the fact is that capitalism developed first in Western Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the rise of capitalism, the European societies, like all the other pre-capitalist societies, changed very slowly. The society was basically organised around farming, which used virtually same technologies for centuries, with limited degree of commerce and handicraft industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between 1000 and 1500, commonly known as the mediaeval period in European history, per capita income in Western Europe grew at 0.12% per year. This is a growth that is almost imperceptible. If your income grows at the rate of 0.12%, it will be only 10% higher when you die at, say, 80 than it was when you were born. At this rate, even after five centuries, the income will only be 82% higher than at the beginning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast, if your per capita income is growing at (roughly), 10% as it has been in China for the last couple of decades (or other East Asian economies, like Japan or Korea, during their economic &lsquo;miracle&rsquo; years in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century), you can achieve a 82% income growth in just over six years. Six years against 500 years &ndash; this means that, in terms of material progress, every year in China today is equivalent to a lifetime (83 years) in Western Europe between 1000 and 1500. No, actually one year in China today is equivalent to three-and-a-half lifetimes in mediaeval Western Europe, where life expectancy was only 24 years.</p>
<p>Having said all this, growth in Western Europe was still a sprint compared to those in Asia or Eastern Europe (including Russia), which is estimated to have grown at one-third the rate (0.04%) during the period. This means that their incomes were only 22% higher after half a millennium. Western Europe may have been moving like a tortoise, but other parts of the world were even slower, like snails.</p>

<h31500-1820: The Dawn of Capitalism</h3>
<p>Things started changing from the 16<sup>th</sup> century &ndash; albeit very slowly in the beginning. Its birth was so slow that we cannot easily detect it from the numbers. During 1500-1820, the growth rate of per capita income in Western Europe was still only 0.14%&ndash; basically the same in all purposes and intents as the one for 1000-1500 (0.12%).</p>
<p>However, in the leading Western European economies of the time, Britain and the Netherlands, there was a visible acceleration in growth by the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, especially in the most dynamic industrial sectors. For example, Britain&rsquo;s cotton textile output, which had grown at 1.4% per year during 1700-60 grew at around 7.7% per year during 1770-1801. Between 1780 and 1790, the growth rate was 12.8% per year &ndash; a&nbsp; rate of growth that would be considered quite high even today, but an astonishing rate at the time, when the overall economy was barely growing. The iron industry increased its output by around 5% per year between 1770 and 1801.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>As a result, during 1500-1820, Britain and the Netherlands achieved per capita economic growth of 0.27% ad 0.28% per year, respectively. They are still very slow by modern standard, but they were more than double their own earlier (1000-1500) growth rates (both 0.12%) and double that of the Western European average during the period (0.14%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behind this acceleration in growth lay a number of changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First came the cultural changes, towards more &lsquo;rational&rsquo; approaches to understanding the world that promoted the rise of modern mathematics and sciences. Many of these ideas were initially borrowed from the Arab world and Asia. However, in the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century, the Western Europeans started adding their innovations. The founding fathers of modern science and mathematics &ndash; Galileo Galilei (astronomy, physics, and many other things) and Francis Bacon (scientific methodology) in the 16<sup>th</sup> century as well as Johannes Kepler (astronomy), Rene Descartes (mathematics), Isaac Newton (physics), Robert Boyle (chemistry), and Pierre de Fermat (mathematics) in the 17<sup>th</sup> century &ndash; are all from this era. The development of science did <em>not</em> immediately affect the broader economy. However, it later provided the systemisation of knowledge that made technological innovations less dependent on individuals and thus more easily transferrable, which encouraged the diffusion of new technologies and thus economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 18<sup>th</sup> century saw the emergence of several new technologies that heralded the advent of a mechanised production system, especially in textiles (e.g., flying shuttle in 1733 and spinning jenny in 1764), steel-making (e.g. coke-smelting in 1709), and chemicals (e.g., processes for large-scale sulphuric-acid manufacture in the 1730s and the 1740s). As we saw in our discussion of Adam Smith&rsquo;s pin factory earlier, finer division of labour was also developing, with the use of continuous assembly lines spreading from the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. In the emergence of these new production technologies, a key driver was the desire to increase production in order to be able to sell more (which then, following Smith&rsquo;s theory of division of labour, made even finer division of labour possible, thereby increasing production even further) and make more profit &ndash; that is, the spread of the mode of capitalist production.</p>
<p>New economic institutions emerged to accommodate the new realities of capitalist production. With expanding production, money required for investments became bigger. This prompted the developments of new lending institutions, like credit society and banks. Emergence of investment projects that involved amounts of capital going well beyond the wealth of even the richest individuals prompted the invention of the limited liability company. Under limited liablity, investors only lost the money they invested, and not all of&nbsp; their personal wealth, as it had been the case under unlimited liability.&nbsp; Initially, limited liability was reserved for large-scale, risky ventures of national significance, such as companies engaged in colonial ventures &ndash; the British (1600) and the Dutch (1602) East India Companies or France&rsquo;s Mississippi Company (1721) &ndash; or large banks. It was generalised (that is, extended to all companies that met some minimum conditions) only in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. With the creation of limited liability companies, the market in their shares &ndash; or the stock market &ndash; was created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In tandem with these internal changes, the Western European countries started to rapidly expand outward from the early 15<sup>th</sup> century (so a bit earlier than the rise of capitalism). This is often euphemistically known as the &lsquo;Age of Discovery&rsquo;, but it basically involved taking away land, resources, and labour force from the native populations through colonialism.</p>
<p>First starting with Portugal in Asia and Spain in the Americas from the late 15<sup>th</sup> century, the Western European nations ruthlessly moved out, occupying territories in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. By the late 18<sup>th</sup> century, North America was divided up between Britain, France, Spain, and the newly-born USA. Most of Latin America was ruled by Spain and Portugal (most Latin American countries got independence in the 1810s and the 1820s). Parts of India were ruled by the British (mainly Bengal and Bihar), the French (the Southeastern coast) and the Portuguese (various coastal areas, especially Goa). Australia was beginning to be settled around this time (the first penal colony was established in 1788). Not much of Africa was affected (yet), with small colonies along the coasts settled by the Portuguese (formerly uninhabited islands of Cape Verde, Sao Tome &amp; Principe) and the Dutch (Cape Town in the 17<sup>th</sup> century).</p>
<p>These expansions brought new resources to Europe. The very early expansions were motivated by the quest for precious metals that were then used as money (gold and silver) and spices (especially black pepper). Over time, plantations using slaves, mostly captives from Africa, were established in the new colonies (especially the US, Brazil, and the Caribbean) to grow and bring back to Europe new crops like (cane) sugar, rubber, cotton, and tobacco. Some of the crops were grown in Europe (and beyond) and became key food items &ndash; it boggles our mind to think of the days when the British did not have their (potato) chips, the Italians did not have their tomatoes and polenta (made with maize, or sweetcorn), and the Indians, the Thais, and the Korean did not have their chillies.</p>
<p>All of these activities, needless to say, were run on capitalist principles. The most symbolic in this respect is the fact that, until 1858, the British rule in India was actually by a company (the East India Company), not by the government.</p>
<p>There is a long-running debate on whether capitalism would have developed without the resources from colonialism of the 16-18<sup>th</sup> century &ndash; precious metal to be used as money, extra food sources (like potato and sugar), and industrial inputs (like cotton). We cannot settle this debate here, but the evidence is probably, on balance, against the proposition that capitalism would not have developed without colonialism.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean the European expansion did not have much impacts on the colonised societies. Native populations were exterminated or driven onto the margins of the society, and their land (and resources over and under it) taken away. The marginalisation of the indigenous population in the Americas has been such that Evo Morales, the current president of Bolivia, elected in 2006, is the first ever head of the state from the indigenous population since the Europeans arrived in 1492. Millions of Africans were captured and shipped out as slaves both by the Europeans and by the Arabs. This was not only tragedy for those who became slaves (if they were lucky enough to survive the atrocious journey) but also depleted the African societies of workers and destroyed their social fabrics. Countries were created out of thin air, with arbitrary boundaries, affecting the internal and the international politics of those countries to this day and age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the more economically advanced parts of the colonised world, colonialism often meant the deliberate destruction of existing productive activities. Most importantly, in 1700, Britain banned the imports of Indian cotton textiles (known as &lsquo;calicoes&rsquo; and considered much superior to coarse English cotton textile products at the time), in order to promote its own cotton textile industry. This dealt a heavy blow to the Indian cotton textile industry, from which it never recovered, as it was subsequently finished off in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by the influx of exports from the British cotton textile industry, which was by then mechanised (see below). And as a colony, India could not use tariffs and other policy measures to protect its own producers against British imports. Last but not least, European colonialism has left deep sense of inferiority in the conquered non-European populations, which lasts until today.</p>

<h3>1820-1870: The Industrial Revolution</h3>
<p>Capitalism really took off and spread from around 1820, with a visible acceleration of economic growth all around Western Europe and then in the &lsquo;Western Offshoots&rsquo; in North America and Oceania. The acceleration of growth during this period was so dramatic that the period is typically referred to as the period of Industrial Revolution.</p>

<div id="box">

	<h3>The Industrial Revolution</h3>
	<p>Unlike political revolutions, such as the French Revolution or the Russian Revolution, economic &lsquo;revolutions&rsquo; do not have clear start and end points. So the Industrial Revolution has been defined to be as long as 1750-1850 or as short as 1820-1870.</p>
	<p>Those who put more weight on technologies tend to date its start somewhere around the mid- to late 18<sup>th</sup> century (say, 1750) on the ground that it is the invention of new technologies in cotton textile, steam engine, and steel-making, made around this time, that were the ultimate driver of the subsequent changes, especially in Britain. Others, who focus more on the socio-economic dimensions tend to date it around the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century on the ground that the impacts of those technologies on economic growth and social transformations (e.g., urbanisation, breakdown of the extended family) were still not very visible until 1800, or even 1820.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>As for the end point, those who put emphasis on leading technology tend to go for the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century (typically 1850) on the ground that the technologies started changing around this time &ndash; from cotton and steam engine to electricity (and electrical equipment), international combustion engine (cars), and new chemical technologies based on organic chemistry. Others who put more emphasis on non-technological factors go for 1870 or 1875. This is because there were significant changes in institutions of capitalism around this time (e.g., the spread of free trade, adoption of limited liability as a standard rule, the emergence of the welfare state) and also because a new, more wide-reaching, and more &lsquo;capitalist&rsquo; round of colonial expansion, typically known as imperialism, started around this time.</p>

</div>

<p>And a revolution it was. I have already mentioned that, until 1820, per capita income in Western Europe grew basically at the same rate as the previous eight centuries, except in Britain and the Netherlands, the first capitalist countries that saw growth acceleration in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century. From around 1820, however, with the spread of capitalism, the pace of economic growth visibly quickened all around Western Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between 1820 and 1870, per capita income in Western Europe grew at 0.98% per year. Of course, 0.98% is not even 1%, which would be considered a very mediocre growth rate these days. But compared to the 0.14% growth rate between 1500 and 1820 (or 0.12% between 1000 and 1500), it was a turbo-charged drive. Growing at 0.98% for 50 years meant that per capita income in Western Europe was 63% higher in 1870 than in 1820. If the growth rate remained at 0.14%, it would have taken nearly 350 years to generate the same increase in income. Compressing 350 years into 50 deserves to be called &lsquo;revolutionary&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In some countries, the growth acceleration was even faster. In Belgium, the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing economy during this period, per capita income growth was 1.44% per year, which means that the Belgian income in 1870 was more than double that in 1820. This was a speed of change that had been unthinkable until then. Switzerland (1.32%) and Britain (1.26%) were not far behind Belgium, while the US (1.34%), the biggest &lsquo;settler&rsquo; colony of Western Europe, grew even faster than those two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acceleration of growth in per capita income, however, was initially accompanied by a fall in living standards for many. Some with old skills &ndash; such as textile artisans &ndash; lost their jobs, as they were replaced by machines operated by much cheaper, unskilled workers, including many children. (In some cases machines were actually designed with the small sizes of children in mind.) Those who were hired to work in factories, or in the small workshops that supplied inputs into them, worked long hours &ndash; 70-80 hours per week was the norm in all Western European countries during this period (with usually only half of Sunday free), with the working hour in certain professions, especially baking, stretching into 16-7 hours per day. Working conditions were extremely hazardous. During this period, many British cotton textile workers died of lung diseases due to the dust generated in the production process. The working class in the urban areas lived in very crowded conditions, sometimes with 15-20 people in a roomwith minimal sanitation. It was typical that hundreds of people shared one toilet <strong>(find more details)</strong>. Under such harsh conditions, the workers died off like flies. In poor areas of Manchester, life expectancy was mere 17 years &ndash; 30% <em>lower</em> than what it had been for the whole of Britain before the Norman Conquest, back in 1000 (24 years).</p>
<p>All of this produced various forms of anti-capitalist movements. Some, like the Luddites &ndash; the textile artisans of England who lost their jobs to mechanised production in the 1810s &ndash; turned to destroying the machines, the most obvious symbol of capitalism. Others, like Robert Owen, searched for utopian socialism based on communal working and living among the like-minded &ndash; rather like the Israeli Kibbutz. Some others, People like Karl Marx, believing that the development of capitalism can only bring &ldquo;immiserisation&rdquo; of the working class, sought to change the situation by overthrowing capitalism and abolishing private ownership of means of production and wage labour, through violent political revolution means if necessary. Yet others thought these problems of immiserisation can be alleviated through reform, rather than abolishment, of capitalism, such as regulation of working hours and working conditions as well as the development of the welfare state.</p>
<p>From hindsight, it is easy to see that the last group read the historical trend the best, as that system is what all rich capitalist economies have today. However, at the time it was not obvious to everyone that workers can be better off under capitalism, not least because there were fierce resistances to reform from most (although not all) capitalists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, from around 1870, there were palpable improvements in the conditions of the working class. Wages went up.&nbsp; At least in Britain, the average adult wage was finally high enough to allow the workers to buy more than the bare necessities (before this, most of them had to supplement their incomes by sending their children to work). There was some reduction in working hours &ndash; some British workers were now working less than 60 hours a week. Life expectancy was up from 35.9 years in 1800 to 41.2 years in 1860. At the end of this period, there were even the beginnings of the welfare state, although it started in Germany rather than in&nbsp; Britain &ndash; the first social welfare programme being the 1871 industrial accident insurance scheme, introduced by Otto von Bismarck, the Chancellor of the newly united Germany.</p>
<p>The birth and the advancement of capitalism in Western Europe (and its &lsquo;offshoots&rsquo;, like the US) in the 19<sup>th</sup> century is often attributed to the adoption of free trade and free market. The conventional wisdom is that countries like Britain and the US forged ahead of the others in capitalist development precisely because they were the first ones to adopt the free market and, especially, free trade.</p>
<p>This cannot be further from the truth. State intervention played a leading role in the early development of capitalism both in Britain and the US. As I detail in the chapter, &lsquo;The Double Life of Daniel Defoe&rsquo; in my book, <em>Bad Samaritans</em>, under the Tudor kings (16-17<sup>th</sup> centuries), Britain tried to develop the woollen textile industry, Europe&rsquo;s then hi-tech industry, led by the Low Countries (especially Flanders in today&rsquo;s Belgium), through government intervention. Tariffs (that is, taxes on imports) protected the British producers from the superior Low-Country producers. The British government sponsored poaching of skilled foreign workers &ndash; the main depositories of technological knowledge at the time &ndash; from those countries (English or American people with names like Flanders, Fleming, or Flemying <strong>check alternative spellings</strong> are distant echoes of those policies). The British government even exploited its position as the main supplier of the raw material for the woollen manufacturing industry in the Low Countries by occasionally putting restrictions on the export of raw wool. These policies were on the whole very successful. By the 18<sup>th</sup> century, woollen textile goods accounted for around half of its export revenue, without which Britain would not have been able to import the food and the raw materials that it needed for its Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>British government intervention to promote economic development was stepped up in 1721, when Robert Walpole, Britain&rsquo;s first Prime Minister, launched an ambitious and wide-ranging industrial development programme, based on tariff protection, government subsidies, and export promotion for &lsquo;strategic&rsquo; industries. Partly thanks to Walpole&rsquo;s programme, Britain started to forge ahead in the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. By the 1770s, Britain was so obviously forging ahead of other countries that Adam Smith saw no need for protectionism and other forms of government intervention. However, it was only nearly century after Smith&rsquo;s <em>WON</em> &ndash; in 1860 &ndash; that Britain fully switch to free trade, when its industrial supremacy was unquestioned (this was the time when Britain produced 20% of world manufacturing output).</p>
<p>The US case is even more interesting. Under British colonial rule, its development of manufacturing was deliberately suppressed. It is reported that, upon hearing about the first attempts by the American colonists to engage in manufacturing, William Pitt the Elder, the British Prime Minister (1766-68) said that the American colonialists should &ldquo;not be permitted to manufacture so much as a horseshoe nail&rdquo;. After gaining independence, many Americans argued that their country had to industrialise if it is to rub shoulders with the likes of Britain and France. Leading this camp was no less than the first ever minister in charge of the US economy, that is, Alexander Hamilton, the Treasury Secretary (that&rsquo;s the guy you see on the $10 bill).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In his 1791 report to the Congress, <em>Report on the Subject of Manufactures</em>, Hamilton developed the theory of infant industry protection, in which he argued that governments of economically backward nations, like the US, needs to protect and nurture the &ldquo;industries in their infancy&rdquo; against superior foreign competitors until they grow up. Hamilton proposed the use of protective tariffs and other measures to help the infant industries &ndash; such as direct subsidies, public investments in infrastructure (especially canals), the patent law to encourage innovations, and policies to develop the banking system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning, the slave-owning landlords from the South who then dominated US politics, thwarted Hamilton&rsquo;s plan. But, following the Anglo-American War of 1812-6 &ndash; the first and so far the last occasion in which the US mainland was invaded &ndash; many Americans came around to Hamilton&rsquo;s view that a strong country needs a strong manufacturing sector, which is not going to happen without tariffs and other government interventions. The only pity was that Hamilton was not there around to see his vision realised. He happened to have been shot dead in a pistol duel a dozen years ago (in 1804) by someone called Aaron Burr &ndash; the serving Vice President of the country at the time (yes, those were wild days &ndash; a serving Vice President shoots a former Treasury Secretary dead and no one goes to prison).</p>
<p>After the shift of direction in 1816, the US trade policy became increasingly<span class="s1"> </span>protectionist. By the 1830s, the country was boasting the highest average industrial tariff in the world &ndash; a status that it kept most of the time for more than a century, until the Second World War.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in the first half of this protectionist century, protectionism remained a constant point of contention, together with slavery and federalism, in US politics. The Southern states that had little industry to protect wanted free trade, as that would allow them to buy higher-quality (and often cheaper) European manufactured products rather than inferior Yankee products. The issue was settled only by the Civil War (1861-5), in which the manufacturing Northern states won. The Northern victory was of course no accident. The North won the Civil War exactly because it had developed manufacturing industry in the previous half a century behind the wall of protectionism. In the classic novel <em>Gone with the Wind</em>, Rhett Butler, the leading male character, tells his Southern compatriots that the Yankees would win the war because they had &ldquo;the factories the foundries, the shipyards, the iron and coal mines &ndash; all the things [the Southerners] haven&rsquo;t got&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Interestingly, during most of the 1820-70 period, tariffs were much lower in countries like Germany, France, and Japan &ndash; which people these days normally associate with protectionism &ndash; than in Britain or the US, the supposed homes of free trade. During this period, Germans even pioneered the first-ever international free trade agreement in the form of the German Customs Union (zollverein) among the dozens of Germanic states (Germany in today&rsquo;s form did not exist until the 1871 &lsquo;re-unification&rsquo;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Towards its end, this period (1820-70) <em>did</em> see the rise of free trade. Britain had been liberalizing trade since the 1840s and adopted full-blown free trade from the 1860s. The 1860s also saw a series of bilateral free-trade agreements among the Western European countries, starting with the famous Anglo-French free trade agreement of 1860 (the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty). Of course, US was a big exception, as it was moving in an increasingly protectionist direction.</p>
<p>Most important in the spread of free trade during this period was something that you would not normally associate with the word, &lsquo;free&rsquo; &ndash; force, or at least the threat of using it. The best-known (although it is not as well-known as it should be) example in this regard was the experience of China. China was forced open by the Opium War in 1842 (in which Britain declared a war on China for confiscating opium, which was a contraband) and made to sign a series of &lsquo;unequal treaties&rsquo; with Western European powers. The treaties deprived the country of, among other things, tariff autonomy (that is, the right to set its own tariffs) and forced it to adopt free trade (it was allowed use a 5% flat-rate tariff to raise government revenue).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other nominally independent countries were also forced to sign unequal treaties and fix their tariffs at 3-5%, which allowed their governments to raise some revenues but not provide &lsquo;infant industry&rsquo; protection for their industries. The Latin American countries had to do that upon gaining independence in the 1810s and the 1820s &ndash; these expired only in the 1870s and the 1880s, upon which most Latin American adopted protectionism (average tariffs in the region of 30-40%<strong>; check figures</strong>). Between the 1820s and the 1850s, a string of other countries were forced to sign unequal treaties and made to practice free trade &ndash; the Ottoman Empire (Turkey&rsquo;s predecessor), Persia (Iran today), and Siam (Thailand today), and even Japan. Upon the forced opening by the American warships in 1853, Japan was forced to sign unequal treaties, which did not expire until 1911, after which, predictably Japan raised its average tariff from 5% to 30% (and even while it was bound by unequal treaties, it imposed one on Korea, which it forced open in 1876 <strong>check date)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inability to protect and promote their &lsquo;infant&rsquo; industries due to direct colonial rule or unequal treaties was a huge contributing factor to the economic retrogression in Asia and Latin America during this period, when they saw <em>negative</em> per capita income growths (at the rates of -0.1% and -0.04% respectively).</p>

<h3>1870-1913: The High Noon</h3>
<p>Capitalism got into a higher gear from around 1870.</p>
<p>Technologically, starting with the Bessemer process in the 1850s for steel-making, clusters of new technological innovations emerged between the 1860s and the first couple of decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. These technologies, unlike the technologies of the early Industrial Revolution that were developed by practical men with good intuition, were mostly developed by the systematic application of scientific and engineering principles, which meant that once something was invented they could be replicated, copied, and improved upon very quickly.</p>
<p>Electricity and various electrical machinery (which eventually led to the electronics revolution of the late 20<sup>th</sup> century), internal combustion engine (both petrol and diesel), synthetic dyes, artificial fertilisers, and so on &ndash; industries that are typically known as &lsquo;heavy and chemical industries&rsquo; &ndash; were all products of this period. In addition, this period produced a revolution in the way the production process is organised in many industries &ndash; that is, the invention of the mass production system. The system, using a <em>moving</em> assembly line (conveyor belt) and interchangeable parts, dramatically lowered production costs. The system is sometimes called Fordism, because Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company who used it to produce his famous Model-T cars (1908), is (somewhat controversially) credited as the inventor of the system. Despite frequent talks of its demise since the 1980s, this system of production (with some modifications &ndash; see later) is still the backbone (if not the entirety) of our production system today.</p>
<p>1870-1913 is also the period when capitalism acquired the basic institutional shape that it has today &ndash; the limited liability company, the central bank, the welfare state, labour laws, the bankruptcy law, and the like. Many of these institutions started emerging in the 1840s, but it was only during the 1870-1913 period that these institutions became adopted in the majority of capitalist countries.</p>
<p>The limited liability companies became the dominant form of business enterprise in Western Europe and the US during this period. The reader may recall from our &lsquo;pin&rsquo; chapter that limited liability used to be granted as a special privilege. Sweden introduced the first generalised limited liability (that is, you did not need special permission to open a limited liability company) in 1844, with Britain following closely with a series of legislations between 1856 and 1862. However, other capitalist countries adopted it only in the 1860s and the 1870s, or even later. With the spread of limited liability companies, the stock market became the centre of the capitalist financial system, although it was still poorly regulated. Banks also became larger and more sophisticated during this period.</p>
<p>During this period, modern bankruptcy law spread. Britain introduced its modern bankruptcy law in 1849. Before this, the bankruptcy covered only very wealthy businessmen and focused on punishing the bankrupt, rather than giving them a second chance through, for example, through court-ordered debt write-offs. The US introduced its modern bankruptcy law only in 1898 at the federal level, which allowed, among other things, time-bound protection from creditors (the famous &lsquo;Chapter 11&rsquo;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central banking in the modern sense (that is, where one bank has monopoly over issuing money and therefore controls the amount of money and the interest rates in the system) had started in Britain, with the granting of note issue monopoly to the Bank of England in 1844. But it was only in the 1890s that the majority of Western European countries acquired such system. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve Board, was established even later &ndash; only at the very end of this period, in 1913.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this period, with the increasing socialist agitation and the reformist pressures in relation to the condition of the working class, a raft of welfare and labour legislations were implemented. Industrial accident insurance, health insurance, old age pension, and unemployment insurance were introduced in most (but not all) capitalist economies in Western Europe and &lsquo;Western offshoots&rsquo; during this period. Many countries also introduced labour regulations for children and women. They banned the employment of younger children (typically, those under 10-12, depending on the country) and restricted the working hours of women and children. However, regulation on the working conditions (including hours) of adult males were considered unacceptable in most countries until towards the end of this period, because they &ndash; unlike women and children &ndash; were considered to be in possession of full mental faculty and therefore would never sign any contract that damages them.</p>
<p>With all these technological and institutional changes, more aggressive investments became possible. Developments of the stock market (thanks to the generalisation of limited liability) and the growing size of the banks made it easier to mobilise finance on very large scales. Generalisation of limited liability and modern bankruptcy law clearly capped the losses from a failed business venture. Such&nbsp; &lsquo;socialisation of risk&rsquo; encouraged risk-taking. Central banking increased economic stability by preventing bank runs, while labour and welfare legislations diminished the threats of revolution and other forms of social conflicts. Since investments, by definition, bring returns in the future, increased economic and political stabilities contributed to more long-term-oriented investments. The combined results were larger-scale, more risky (but higherreturn), and more long-term-oriented investments, which resulted in more rapid growth.</p>
<p>Despite the Long Depression of 1873-96, during which many economies stagnated <strong>(data from Dow)</strong>, growth rate of per capita income in Western Europe rose from 0.98% during 1820-70 to 1.33%. For the world economy as a whole, per capita income grew at 1.31% during 1870-1913, compared to 0.54% during 1820-70.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The liberal commentators attribute this growth acceleration to the fact that during this period the world economy was more integrated than ever through free trade, free movement of capital, and free international migration (this was the time when you could travel without a passport). They also argue that this market liberalisation on a global scale was matched by the ascendancy (if not a total dominance) of free-market policies in domestic economic affairs. Hands-off policies towards business, balanced budget, and the Gold Standard (a system in which countries could not issue more money than they had in gold &ndash; a very good way of restricting money supply) were the key ingredients, they say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This standard story is fundamentally misleading, if not outright wrong, in many respects.</p>
<p>First of all, the 1870-1913 period did <em>not </em>see universal liberalisation and opening-up on the international front. In the heartland of capitalism, in Western Europe and the US, there was actually an increase, not a decrease, in trade protectionism. In fact, during this period the US became even more protectionist than before, following the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. Most Western European countries that had signed free trade agreements in the 1860s and the 1870s did not renew them after their expiry (they usually had 20 year lifetime) and significantly increased their protectionism. This was partly to protect the agricultural sector that was struggling with new cheap imports from the New World (especially the US and Argentina) and Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine) but also to protect and promote the newly-emerging heavy and chemical industries. Germany and Sweden were the best examples of this &lsquo;new protectionism&rsquo; (famously called the &lsquo;marriage of iron and rye&rsquo; in Germany).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, much of international opening-up that happened during this period was due to the spread of colonialism. Not for nothing this period is also known as the Age of Imperialism. There was a new wave of colonisation. In particular, between the 1880s and the First World War that marked the end of this period, there was the &lsquo;scramble for Africa&rsquo;, while a lot of Asia (Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar by Britain; Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos by France) was also taken as colonies during this period. Especially the British Empire expanded enormously during this period, ultimately backed up by its industrial might. The number of its colonies increased from around 20 in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century to more than three times that, covering around 1/3 of the globe (&lsquo;The sun never sets on the British Empire.&rsquo;). Moreover, countries that had not so far engaged in much colonialism &ndash; Germany (Tanzania, Namibia, Rwanda, Burundi, Togo, etc.), the US (Cuba and the Philippines), Belgium (Congo), and Japan (Korea, Taiwan, and Manchuria) &ndash; also joined in during this period. Thus seen, much of increased economic openness during this period was due to force &ndash; even more so than in the previous period.</p>
<p>Last but not least, in terms of domestic policy too, this period saw a marked increase in government intervention in the core capitalist countries, even though there was a strong adherence to free-market doctrines in the area of macroeconomic policy &ndash; especially balanced budget and the Gold Standard. We have already discussed how the government began exercising more control over the financial sector, through central banking especially, and started addressing labour issue, through labour legislation and welfare schemes. There was more. This is also the period in which governments in many advanced capitalist countries started investing heavily in infrastructure (especially railways) and in education (especially the US and Germany). The strengthening of protectionism in most advanced capitalist economies meant that, on the whole their governments were much more deeply involved in affecting industrial development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the liberal (in the European sense <strong>address this earlier? Or create a box about &lsquo;adjectives&rsquo;</strong>) golden age of 1870-1913 was not as liberal as we think. It was getting less liberal in the core capitalist countries, in terms of both domestic and international policies. Liberalisation happened mostly in the weaker countries, but out of compulsion rather than choice &ndash; that is, through colonialism and unequal treaties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very important phenomenon of this period in this regard is the massive growth acceleration in Latin America (from -0.04% growth in per capita income during 1820-70 to 1.86% per capita per year) to become the fastest growing region in the world (higher than that of the US, 1.82%, the second place). It was not a coincidence because this is exactly when Latin America became truly independent, with the expiry of the unequal treaties in the 1870s and the 1880s.</p>

<h3>1914-45: The Turmoil</h3>
<p>The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 signalled the end of an era for capitalism. So far, despite constant threats of revolt by the poor (1848 revolution across Europe, 1871 Paris commune, etc.) and economic problems (the Long Depression), the only way for capitalism seemed to be up &ndash; and outward.</p>
<p>This view was rudely shaken by the First World War (1914-19). The War totally discredited the then popular view that the thickening web of commerce capitalism was building around the globe would make wars between nations thus intertwined highly unlikely, if not totally impossible.</p>
<p>At one level, the outbreak of the First World War should not have been surprising, given that the &lsquo;globalisation&rsquo; of the preceding period had been in large part driven by imperialism, and not just economic competition, as we have discussed. This meant that the international rivalry between the leading capitalist countries had a high chance of escalating into violent conflicts. Some went even further and argued that capitalism had reached a stage in which it cannot be sustained without continuous outward expansion, which has to come to an end sooner or later, marking the end of capitalism.</p>
<p>This was the view most famously expounded in <em>Imperialism &ndash; The Highest Stage of Capitalism</em> by Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Russian Revolution in 1917. The Russian Revolution was an even big shock to the defenders of capitalism than the First World War, as it led to the creation of an economic system that undermined all the corner-stones of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the Russian Revolution, private property in the means of production was abolished &ndash; although not overnight and rather slowly over a decade. The big break came with the agricultural collectivisation in 1928, in which the lands of large farmers, or gulags, were confiscated and turned into state farms and small farmers were forced to join agricultural cooperatives, which were state farms in another name. Markets were eventually abolished and replaced by full-blown central planning by 1928, with the start of the first Five Year Plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, by 1928, the Soviet Union had an economic system that was definitely not capitalist. It ran without private ownership of means of production, profit motives, and markets. As for the other cornerstone of capitalism, wage labour, the picture was more complicated. Yes, in theory the Soviet workers were not wage labourers because they were after all owners of all the means of production &ndash; through state ownership or cooperatives. However, in practice they were indistinguishable from wage labourers in a capitalist economy &ndash; they had little control over the way their enterprises and the wider economy operated and their daily work experience was still subject to the same hierarchical relationship that capitalism subjects its workers to.</p>
<p>The Soviet socialism was a huge economic (and social) experiment. Until then, no economy had been run according to a central plan. Karl Marx, the leading advocate of central planning, left the details rather vague and the Soviet Union had to make up things as it went along this un-trodden path. However, even many Marxists were sceptical about the prospect of the Soviet Union. According to Marx and his theory of &lsquo;scientific socialism&rsquo;, socialism was supposed to emerge from the most developed capitalist economies in which the social division of labour is so developed that economic activities are already planned on very large scales by large enterprises and cartels of those enterprises, which is only a step away from a fully planned economy. The Soviet Union &ndash; even its more developed European part &ndash; was a very backward economy in which capitalism had been hardly developed, where socialism really had no business of emerging.</p>
<p>To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the early Soviet industrialisation was a big success, most graphically proven by its ability to repel the Nazi advance on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. Income per capita is estimated to have grown at 5% per year between 1928 and 1938 &ndash; an astonishingly rapid rate in a world in which income typically grew at 1-2% per year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This growth actually came at very high costs in terms of the millions of deaths from political repression and the 1932 famine, which was the result of an attempt to industrialise too quickly. To simplify the story a bit, basically too much food was shipped out of the rural areas in in order to feed the rapidly-rising urban population and to earn foreign exchanges with which to import advanced machinery that the Soviet Union needed for industrialisation. However, the scale of the 1932 famine was not known at the time, and many people were impressed by this performance &ndash; especially so because this was happening at a time when capitalism was down on its knees, following the Great Depression of 1929.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Great Depression of 1929 was an even more traumatic event than the Russian Revolution and the rise of socialism. This was especially the case for the US, in which the Depression started (with the infamous 1929 Wall Street crash) and which was the hardest hit by the experience. Between 1929 and 1932, in the US, output fell by 30% and unemployment increased by nearly 8 times, from 3.1% to 23.6%. It was not until 1937 that the US output gained its 1929 level. Germany and France also suffered badly, with their outputs falling by 16% and 15% during the same period.</p>
<p>One persistent liberal myth is that this large but totally manageable financial crisis was turned into a Great Depression because of the collapse in world trade, caused by the &lsquo;trade war&rsquo; prompted by the adoption of protectionism by the US through the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariffs. However, this story does not really stand scrutiny. First, the tariff increase by Smoot-Hawley was not very dramatic &ndash; it raised the average US industrial tariff from 37% to 48%. Second, it did not really cause a massive tariff war. Except for a few economically weak countries like Italy and Spain, protectionism did not increase very much following Smoot-Hawley. Third and most importantly, studies show that the main reason for the collapse in international trade after 1929 was not tariff increases but the downward spiral in international demands, as the Gold Standard system forced countries to cut their spending (including what they spend on imports) in order to stem the outflows of money (that is, gold).</p>
<p>The ultimate cause of the Great Depression was the poorly regulated US financial system, which had led to a huge asset bubble that burst in 1929. However, the downturn following the bursting of the bubble was made much worse by the rigidities in the macroeconomic policy regime, due to the doctrine of the balanced budget and the Gold Standard in the leading capitalist economies of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is natural that private sector spending falls after a financial crisis like the 1929 Wall Street crash (or for that matter the 2008 Credit Crunch), as debts are unpaid, banks reduce their credits, and consumers who cannot get credits any more cut their spending. With such fall in demand, companies go bankrupt or at least scale down their activities. This, in turn, reduces demands for other firms and individuals that used to sell to those firms (e.g., other firms selling machinery, farmers selling raw materials, workers selling labour services). The affected firms then also reduce their activities, while unemployed workers reduce their consumption. The aggregate demands in the economy spirals down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this situation, the government is the only economic agent that can spend and maintain the level of demands in the economy, as it cannot go bankrupt, as far as it can issue its own currency. Unfortunately, in the days of the Great Depression, this was not done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main reason for this was that there was such a strong belief in the balanced budget doctrine (which some people still adhere to) at the time. If the government is to balance its budget in a situation in which the tax revenue is falling due to decreased level of economic activity, it has to cut its spending. This is what the governments of the advanced capitalist economies did following the Great Depression, which meant that they made up only a minimal, if any, amount of the collapse in private sector demand. This experience contrasts with the first couple of years of the 2008 global financial crisis. Despite the fact that the magnitude of collapse in private sector activities (and thus tax revenues) in 2008 was comparable to, or even bigger in some respects than, that in 1929, the rich country governments maintained, or even somewhat increased, their spending. The Chinese government increased its spending massively. All of this prevented the world economy from collapsing in 2008-9, in contrast to in the days following the Great Depression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, as we mentioned earlier, the Gold Standard meant that countries could maintain the value of their currency (tied to gold) only by cutting imports by reducing overall demand. This contrasts with the monetary policy of the recent period, which has involved drastic cuts in interest rates (the interest rate of the Bank of England, which was established in 1684, has never been lower) and the so-called &lsquo;quantitative easing&rsquo;, that is increasing the sheer quantity of money (not necessarily notes) in circulation when interests rates cannot be lowered further. Of course, there are questions about the effectiveness of quantitative easing in the present form, in which the money mainly stays in bank balance sheets or flows into commodity speculation (directing the extra liquidity into productive businesses may be more productive), but there is no doubt that this freedom of action given by the ability to &lsquo;print money&rsquo; has allowed countries not to have to resort to deflationary policies to stay solvent in the current crisis.</p>
<p>The Great Depression left a lasting mark on capitalism. With it came the widespread rejection of the laissez-faire doctrine and serious attempts to reform capitalism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reforms were particularly widespread and far-reaching in the US, where the Depression was the greatest and lasted the longest. The so-called First New Deal programme (1933-4) under the new president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, broke the banks into retail and investment banking (the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act), set up the bank deposit insurance system (to protect small savers against bank failures), tightened stock market regulation (the 1933 Federal Securities Act), expanded and strengthened the farm credit system, provided minimum farm price guarantee, and developed infrastructure (such as the Hoover Dam &ndash; that&rsquo;s the one you see in the 1978 <em>Superman</em> movie), and so on. There were even more reforms under the so-called the Second New Deal (1935-8), including the Social Security Act (1935), that introduced old age pension and unemployment insurance, and the Wagner Act (1935), which strengthened trade unions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sweden was another country where significant reforms were introduced following the Great Depression. Sweden was one of the hardest hit countries by the Great Depression, with output falling by <strong>x% between 1929 and 1932</strong> and unemployment reaching 25% in 1932 under orthodox macroeconomic policies. The Social Democratic Party that came to power in 1932 and introduced a series of reforms. Income tax was introduced &ndash; surprisingly belatedly for a country that is today considered the bastion of income tax (Britain introduced income tax in 1842 and even the famously anti-tax US in 1913). The revenues were used to expand the welfare state (especially the introduction of an unemployment insurance system and the increase in the old-age pension) and to help the farmers (expansion of the farm credit system and minimum price guarantee). At the same time, active fiscal policies &ndash; increasing government spending during recessions to counter the fall in private sector demand (and doing the opposite in boom times) were implemented. The Swedish practice was not highly theorised, so this is sometimes known as &lsquo;Keynesian policies before Keynes&rsquo;, whose 1936 book <em>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</em> established theoretical justification for such policies. In 1938, the centralised trade union and the centralised employers&rsquo; association signed the Saltsj&ouml;baden Agreement, establishing industrial peace. <strong>(add more history from Pontusson)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other countries did not go as far as the US or Sweden in reforming capitalism during this period, but their reforms presaged the shape of things to come. As we shall shortly see, after the Second World War, active (Keynesian) fiscal policy aimed at full employment, higher progressive income tax, beefed-up welfare state, increased public investments, legal supports for greater trade union power, and tougher regulation on the financial sector became the norm in the advanced capitalist countries, with Sweden and the US setting the boundaries on the left and the right in most of these areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The turmoil of the 1914-45 period reached its peak with the outbreak of the Second World War, which killed tens of millions of people, both soldiers and civilians (higher estimates put the death toll at 60 million). The result was the reversal in the acceleration in economic growth since the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per capita income growth rate for the world, which accelerated from 0.05% during 1500-1820, to 0.54% during 1820-1870, and then to 1.31% during 1870-1913, fell to 0.88% during 1914-50 (the 1914-45 figure is not readily available). The Soviet Union remained the fastest growing region of the world, with 1.76% growth rate, higher than 1.61% of the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Latin America was the second fastest-growing region in the world, and indeed fastest-growing capitalist region in the world, with 1.41% per capita income growth rate during this period. During the latter part of this period, the Latin American countries tried to shift their economic bases from primary commodities to manufacturing industries, using tariff protection and other measures of government intervention. This strategy is commonly known as &lsquo;import substitution industrialisation&rsquo; (ISI) strategy &ndash; meaning that you are &lsquo;substituting&rsquo; imported manufactured goods with your own. This change in strategy was prompted by the Great Depression, the collapse of the world trading system after which forced the Latin American countries to start making things themselves. But it was ultimately due to the emergence of new political coalitions between capitalists and their workers, challenging the traditional &lsquo;landed oligarchy&rsquo;. Getulio Vargas of Brazil (presidents 1930-45 and then 1951-54) and Lazaro Cardenas of Mexico (president 1934-40) are the most famous of the Latin American leaders of this time, but similar changes happened in a number of other Latin American countries.</p>
<p>Asia (except Japan, which was now an imperialist country) &ndash; today the centre of economic growth in the world &ndash; could not even maintain the modest growth pick-up during the previous period (from -0.10% to 0.43%) and regressed again during this period (-0.08%).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1945-73: The Golden Age</h3>
<p>The period between 1945, the end of the Second World War, and 1973, the first Oil Shock, is typically known as the &lsquo;Golden Age of capitalism&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The period really deserves the name, as it achieved the highest growth rate ever in the history of capitalism. Between 1950 and 1973 (so not quite from 1945), per capita income in Western Europe grew at an astonishing 4.05% per year. The US economy did not grow as fast as the European ones, but its per capita income still grew at an unprecedented rate of 2.45% per year. Some countries did even better. Per capita income in West Germany grew at 5.02% during 1950-73, granting the title of the &lsquo;Miracle on the Rhine&rsquo; to the country, with Austria closely following behind with 4.98% growth rate. Japan grew even faster at 8.06%, starting off the chain of &lsquo;economic miracles&rsquo; in East Asia in the next half a century.</p>
<p>High growth was not the only economic achievement during this period. Unemployment, the bane of life for the working class, was virtually eliminated during this period. Before the Golden Age, Unemployment rates in the advanced capitalist economies were typically in the range of 3-7% and frequently shot up well above 10%. At the depth of the Great Depression, unemployment reached 33% in Germany, 32% in Denmark, and 25% in the US and Sweden, and 23% in the UK. In contrast, during the Golden Age, average unemployment rate for the advanced capitalist countries (ACCs: Western Europe, Japan, and the US) was around 3% - it was close to zero in Switzerland (yes, that&rsquo;s possible), 1-2% in Japan and Western Europe (in Switzerland, it was often zero) and 3-5% even in the US, where unemployment rate was considerably higher than in comparable economies during the period.</p>
<p>There was also a high degree of macroeconomic stability on a number of accounts &ndash; output (and thus employment), prices, and finance.</p>
<p>First, output stability was much higher &ndash; that is, it fluctuated much less &ndash; than in the previous periods, not least thanks to Keynesian fiscal policy (increasing government spending during downturns and reducing it during booms). Second, price stability was also high. The average inflation for the ACCs during this period was around 4%. This was higher than it was historically (0.2% in 1820-70, 0.4% in 1870-1913, and -0.7% during 1920-38), but it was much lower than what followed (see below) and, more importantly, did not cause many problems, as it was happening in the context of rapidly-growing income for most people, which meant that their incomes were rising fast even considering inflation (&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never had it so good&rdquo;, as Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister, put in 1952 <strong>check date)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More importantly, although this is a point that is not frequently highlighted, there was a very high degree of financial stability. During the Golden Age, virtually no country was in banking crisis. Between the mid-1970s and the late 1980s, the proportion of countries with banking crisis rose to 5- 10%, weighted by their share of world income. This proportion shot up to around 20% in the mid-1990s. The ratio then briefly fell to zero for a few years in the mid-2000s, but went up again to 35% following the 2008 global financial crisis (with another global financial crisis looming at the time of writing &ndash; middle of 2012 &ndash; the ratio could go up again).</p>
<p>So all around &ndash; in terms of growth, (un)employment, output fluctuation, inflation, and financial stability &ndash; the Golden Age was a remarkable period. Exactly what lay behind the sterling economic performance that was unprecedented and has since been unparalleled is a matter of on-going dispute.</p>
<p>Some point out that there was an unusually large pool of new technologies that were waiting to be exploited and thus give impetus to growth. A lot of new technologies were developed during the Second World War for military purposes but most of them had a lot of civilian uses. Computers, electronics, radar, jet engines, synthetic rubber, microwave (applied from radar technology) &ndash; the list goes on.</p>
<p>There were also some important changes in the international economic system that facilitated economic development during the Golden Age. The 1944 meeting of the Allies in the Second World War in the New Hampshire resort of Bretton Woods established two key institutions of the post-war financial system, which was thus dubbed the Bretton Woods System. First, the International Monetary Fund was established to provide short-term funding to countries in balance of payments crises, while providing mechanisms to adjust exchange rates in an orderly way (all currencies were fixed and linked to the US dollar, which until 1971 was freely convertible to gold). Second, the World Bank was established to provide more long-term loans, typically with more favourable terms than those offered by the private-sector banks, mainly in the form of &lsquo;project lending&rsquo; (that is, money that is given to particular investment projects, like building a dam). Today, people think of the World Bank as the bank for poor countries, but its first clients were the war-torn economies of Europe (this is reflected in its official name, which is the International Bank for <em>Reconstruction</em> and Development).</p>
<p>Making up the third leg of the post-WWII world economic system was the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs), which was signed in 1947. Between 1947 and 1967, the GATT organised six series of negotiations (called &lsquo;Rounds&rsquo;) that resulted in the cuts in tariffs (mostly) among the rich countries.</p>
<p>The new global economic order that emerged was that of controlled and gradual liberalisation. Except the US and a few countries, there were strict controls on cross-border flows of capital (&lsquo;capital control&rsquo;) during the Golden Age <strong>(info from Reclaiming &ndash; Glyn et al., p. 102 says that the US abolished all capital control in 1974, so check facts)</strong>. A lot of countries, not just developing countries but the then relatively advanced countries, like Japan and Finland, put severe restrictions on direct investments by foreign firms (known as foreign direct investments), attaching conditions related to joint venture, technology transfer, export, and so on even in industries where FDI is allowed. This was in order to protect their national firms from competition and, if foreign firms are let in, the national economy gets access to their advanced technologies and management techniques. It is true that tariffs came down quite a lot in the advanced capitalist economies during this period <strong>(get figures)</strong> but tariffs were still quite high in the developing countries. Despite this, trade grew fast, thanks to the rapid growth of national economies, suggesting that it is the overall level of economic activity, rather than tariffs (and other measures of trade protectionism) that is more important in determining the level of international trade. I have made the same point when discussing the collapse of world trade during the Great Depression in the previous section.</p>
<p>In Europe, a new experiment in international integration with far-reaching consequences was started during the Golden Age that tried to bind together countries that have been fighting wars with each other for centuries through greater economic ties. It started with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951, which coordinated efforts to upgrade the production facilities in the coal and the steel industries of six countries &ndash; West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. This was followed by the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community (EEC) &ndash; a free-trade agreement &ndash; and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euroatom). In 1967, these three Communities were integrated to form the European Communities (EC). In 1973, the EC got a critical boost, with the accession of the UK, Ireland, and Denmark.</p>
<p>Important the technological factors and the new international economic system may have been, the consensus view that the Golden Age was the result of reforms in economic policies and institutions that encouraged growth, stability, and equality. We have already discussed many of the precursors of these in the previous section, when we talked about the post-Great Depression reforms in the US and Sweden. But, after the Second World War, most capitalist economies came to adopt these reforms, resulting in the rise of the &lsquo;mixed economy&rsquo; &ndash; not quite capitalist, not quite socialist.</p>
<p>Tougher financial regulations established financial stability, while Keynesian macroeconomic policies, geared towards full employment, and more active role of central banks ensured that economic fluctuations are minimised while the overall level of demand remains high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welfare measures, first introduce in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, were vastly strengthened, with the provision of some basic services nationalised in some countries (e.g., Britain&rsquo;s National Health Service). These were funded by a large increase in taxes (as a proportion of national income), especially progressive income tax, in which those earn more pay higher rates of tax. Better welfare measures increased social mobility, increasing the legitimacy of the capitalist system. The resulting social peace encouraged more long-term-oriented investments and thus growth.</p>
<p>Labour market regulations were strengthened in relation to many aspects of employment contracts &ndash; wages, working conditions, redundancy, unfair dismissal, and union power. In countries like Germany, laws were introduced to formally involve workers in company decisions (the &lsquo;co-determination&rsquo; system). The sheer increase in union membership after the Second World War in countries like Sweden, Finland, and Austria, meant that the centralised trade unions bargained with the centralised employers&rsquo; association on wages and other working conditions. In Japan, companies struck an implicit deal with their respective unions and started offering (informally) &lsquo;lifetime employment&rsquo; to the core workers (say, 2/3 of the workers in large firms and 1/3 of the workers in small companies).</p>
<p>During the Golden Age, most governments in the advanced capitalist economies also took more interventionist roles in the management of the productive sector, and not just in macroeconomic, welfare, and labour issues. Governments in France, Austria, Finland, and Norway nationalised many productive enterprises after the War. Their national governments also practised industrial policies that deliberately promoted targeted &lsquo;strategic&rsquo; industries (commonly known as &lsquo;selective industrial policies&rsquo;) through (once again) measures, like trade protection, subsidies, restrictions on investments by foreign firms (known as foreign direct investment), favours in procurement policy, and investments in infrastructure and education. In countries like Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, selective industrial policies were practised much more by the local governments, rather than the national government.</p>
<p>The French government did not stop at promoting particular industries but went one step further and tried to coordinate policies across industrial sectors through the Five Year Plan. Despite the name, the French plan was not &lsquo;compulsory&rsquo; one, like that of the Soviet union, but an &lsquo;indicative&rsquo; one. The government set broad targets in overall economic growth and outputs in some key sectors (e.g., coal, steel) and backed these up by directing funds into the necessary areas through budgetary spending and bank credits (a task made easier in France by the fact that many banks were state-owned at the time). The Japanese government also practised indicative planning (not as forcefully as the French one) and selective industrial policy (even more forcefully than the French one). The Japanese model was very successfully emulated (with due adaptations to the local conditions) by countries like South Korea and Taiwan since the 1960s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US government had little official industrial policy but it conducted a huge amount of industrial policy under another name. Throughout the post-war period, but in particular until the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, the US federal government provided 50-70% of the nation&rsquo;s R&amp;D funding through its defence and health research programmes. This was way higher than in Japan (around 20%) and the highest among the ACCs, so we can say that during this period (and beyond) the US government had more impact on the nation&rsquo;s technological and industrial development than in any other comparable nation. Most of the industries in which the US still maintains world technological leadership have been initially created and often further developed by federal R&amp;D programmes &ndash; computers (funded by the Pentagon), semi-conductors (US Navy), aircraft (US Air Forces), the internet (the DAPRA, Defence Advanced Projects Research Agency), pharmaceuticals and life sciences (National Institutes of Health).</p>
<p>There were a number of reasons for the decisive shift towards the &lsquo;mixed economy&rsquo; model among the ACCs during the Golden Age. First, following the Great Depression and other economic troubles of the inter-war period, most people came to accept the limits of laissez-faire capitalism. Second, the success in wartime planning during the Second World War reduced resistance to government intervention, even in countries the US and Britain, which were ideologically more resistant to active government. This made planning and industrial policy more acceptable. Third, in many European countries, there were electoral successes by parties of the left, thanks to their key roles in fighting Fascism. These parties further pushed policies that favoured the workers and other poorer people in the society &ndash; the welfare state, greater labour rights, and higher taxes. Last but not least, the systemic competition with the supposedly pro-worker Soviet bloc necessitated some political concession to the workers.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that emerges even from this very quick and superficial run-down of changes in the policies and the institutions of the advanced capitalist countries after the Second World War is their diversity. Even though there were some international differences in the way capitalism is organised in the early days of capitalism, the differences became much more pronounced by the post-WWII reforms. Now, American capitalism was distinctly different from the German or the French ones, not to speak of the Japanese or the Swedish ones, which were all different from each other. The recognition of this diversity is not just a matter of satisfying the economic birdwatcher&rsquo;s curiosity but is important in providing us with the information with which to fight the currently (that is, post-1980) dominant (albeit weakening) orthodoxy that there is just one best way of running capitalism and that is the American way. We will return to this issue later.</p>
<p>The Golden Age also saw widespread de-colonisation (unequal treaties had mostly expired in the 1920s and the 1930s). Starting with Korea in 1945, India (from which Pakistan separated) in 1947, Burma in 1948, and Indonesia in 1949, most colonies all over the world gained independence during the Golden Age. Independence in many nations involved violent struggles against the colonisers &ndash; the wars and uprisings in Vietnam (1945-54, against the French), Indonesia (1945-49, against the Dutch), Kenya (especially the Mau Mau movement against the British, 1952-56), and Algeria (1954-62, against the French) being particularly famous. Independence came later to Sub-Saharan Africa, with Kenya becoming the first independent country in 1957. Around half the Sub-Saharan African countries became independent in the first half of the 1960s. Some nations had to wait longer (Angola and Mozambique in 1975 from Portugal; Namibia in 1990 from South Africa; Hong Kong in 1997 from Britain) and some are still waiting, but the vast majority of former colonial societies gained independence by the end of the Golden Age.</p>
<p>Upon independence, most post-colonial nations rejected the free-market and free-trade policies that had been imposed on them under colonialism and pushed for government-led industrial development, following the Latin American example since the 1930s, which we discussed in the previous section. Some of them became outright socialist (China, North Korea, North Vietnam, and Cuba), but even those that remained basically capitalist used a lot of state intervention to develop manufacturing industries, whose absence was after all seen as the root cause of their colonisation (in this they shared the view of the Americans following the War of Independence and the Anglo-American War).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, most developing countries erected the wall of tariffs and other protective measures and, behind it, provided help to domestic capitalists &ndash; subsidies, public investments in infrastructure, favours in government procurement. To further protect their domestic firms, many of them also put restrictions on what companies from their former colonisers and other rich capitalist countries &ndash; by this time known as Multi-national Corporations (MNCs), on account of the fact that they had operations in many nations &ndash; can own and do, including requirements that their investments had to be joint ventures with local partners or that they need to buy certain proportion of their inputs from local firms. In some cases, the government set up state-owned enterprises and got into production activities directly because there was simply no local capitalist that was willing to take the necessary risk. POSCO, the South Korean steel company that is the fifth largest steel producer in the world, and EMBRAER, the Brazilian company that is the third largest producer of aircraft in the world, were both established as state-owned enterprises in the late 1960s (1968 and 1969 respectively) for this reason (both are now private companies). While many companies formerly owned by the colonisers were nationalised upon independence, some post-colonial countries subsequently started to.</p>
<p>With independence dates stretching from 1945 to 1973 and beyond, it is impossible to talk about the &lsquo;economic performance of developing countries during the Golden Age&rsquo;. The usual compromise timeframe for judging developing country economic performance is 1960-80. According to the World Bank data, during this period, per capita income in the developing countries grew at 3% per year. Given that the developed capitalist economies grew at 3.2% in per capita terms, the developing countries were keeping up with the more advanced economies. Some countries did far better than this. The &lsquo;miracle&rsquo; economies of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong grew at 6-7% in per capita terms <strong>(find more exact data from the WB) </strong>during this period, achieving some of the fastest growth rates in human history (together with Japan before them and China after them).</p>
<p>One thing to note, however, is that even the more slowly-growing developing regions saw considerable progress during this period. During 1960-80, with per capita income growth of 1.6% per year, Sub-Saharan Africa was the slowest growing region in the world &ndash; Latin America grew at double that rate (3.1%), and East Asia at 4 times the rate <strong>(get the number)</strong>. However, this is still not a growth rate to be sniffed at. Recall that during its Industrial Revolution (1820-70), the growth rate of per capita income in Western Europe was not even 1% (0.98%) and that the fastest-growing economy in the world at the time, Belgium, was growing &ndash; at 1.44% per year &ndash; more slowly (in per capita terms) than Sub-Saharan Africa during this period.</p>
<p>The Golden Age of Capitalism has shown that capitalism works best when it is properly regulated and restrained. In the rich countries, this period saw significant increases in government intervention (taxes, subsidies, regulations, state ownership, etc.) in many areas (there were areas where the opposite happened &ndash; tariffs fell). Despite this &ndash; or rather because of this to an extent &ndash; economies grew fast, remained stable, and became more equal. In developing countries, following de-colonisation, there were even more dramatic increase in many areas (although not so much in relation to labour rights and social policy). Most of these countries did very well at least in terms of economic growth and financial stability, if not necessarily in terms of inflation and income inequality. Economic performances both in the rich and in the developing countries have never been better before or since the Golden Age, despite considerably lower degrees of government intervention.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1973-79: The Interregnum</h3>
<p>The Golden Age came to an end early in the 1970s. The turning point came with the suspension of US dollar-gold convertibility in 1971. In the Bretton Woods system, the old Gold Standard was abandoned on the recognition that it made macroeconomic management too rigid, as seen during the Great Depression. However, the system was ultimately &lsquo;anchored&rsquo; in gold, because the US dollar, which had fixed exchange rates with all the other major currencies, was freely convertible to gold (at $35 per ounce). This, of course, was based on the assumption that the dollar was &lsquo;as good as gold&rsquo; &ndash; not an unreasonable assumption when the US was producing about half of world&rsquo;s output and there was an acute dollar shortage all around the world, as everyone wanted to buy American things. However, with the re-building and then rapid development of other economies, this assumption was not valid any more and the US experienced constant fall in its gold reserve. In 1971, the US dropped its commitment to convert any dollar claims into gold, which eventually led other countries to stop tying their currencies to the dollar at fixed rates within the next couple of years.</p>
<p>The end of the Golden Age is marked by the First Oil Shock in 1973, in which oil prices rose by four times overnight, thanks to the price collusion of the cartel of the oil-producing countries, the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries). Inflation rates had been slowly rising in many countries since the late 1960s but, following the Oil Shock, it shot up into the double-digit territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More importantly, the next several years was characterised by &lsquo;stagflation&rsquo;. This newly-coined term was referring to the breakdown of the age-long economic regularity that prices tend to fall during a recession (or stagnation) and rise (inflation) during a boom. Now there was a new situation in which the economy was stagnating (not exactly in a prolonged recession, like during the Great Depression) but prices were rising at the rates of 10%, 15%, or even higher &ndash; the average inflation rate of Europe reached up to 15% while the US rate also surged above 10%. The UK suffered particularly strongly, with inflation rate reaching almost 25% in the UK in 1975.</p>
<p>The Second Oil Shock in 1979 finished off the Golden Age by bringing about another bout of high inflation and bringing more market-oriented (also known as &lsquo;neo-liberal&rsquo;) governments first in the UK (Margaret Thatcher, 1979) and then the US (Ronald Reagan, 1980). In the 1980s, other key capitalist countries, especially West Germany (Helmut Kohl, 1982), also moved into a more liberal direction, although the degree of change in those countries were much less. We shall talk about these shortly.</p>
<p>This &lsquo;transition&rsquo; period is often depicted as a period of unmitigated economic disaster, especially by free-market economists who are critical of the &lsquo;mixed economy&rsquo; model that characterised the Golden Age. However, overall, this period saw robust growth. Growth certainly slowed down significantly in the rich capitalist economies from 3.8% during 196-70 to 2.0% during 1973-80, in per capita terms. However, this was still much better than those of the previous periods (1.4% in 1870-1913 and 1.2% in 1913-50) and basically the same as what followed in the next three decades of market liberalism (1.9% for 1980-2009). Unemployment was, at 4.1%, higher than during the Golden Age, but not by much (3%).</p>

<h3>1980- today: The rise and fall of Neoliberalism</h3>
<p>Whether or not the standard portrayal of the 1973-80 period as one of an unmitigated disaster is correct, there was enough dissatisfaction with what was happening for there to be radical changes in the following years.</p>
<p>The first major turning point came with the election of Margaret Thatcher as the British Prime Minister in 1979. Rejecting the traditional &lsquo;wet&rsquo; Tory compromise with Labour on the &lsquo;mixed economy&rsquo;, Thatcher pursued an agenda of radical dismantling of the &lsquo;mixed economy&rsquo;. She lowered income taxes, reduced government spending (especially in education, housing, and transport), introduced laws reducing union power, abolished capital control, and privatised a lot of areas (gas, water, electricity, steel, airline, automobile, part of public housing). In the early years, she also raised interest rates to control inflation by dampening economic activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resulting rise in the cost of borrowing resulted in a huge recession, as consumers and companies retrenched, between 1979 and 1983, in which unemployment soared to 3.3 million people &ndash; this under a government that came to power by criticising James Callaghan&rsquo;s Labour government&rsquo;s record on unemployment, which went over the 1 million mark, under the slogan &ldquo;Labour isn&rsquo;t working&rdquo;. This recession, when combined with the rise in the value of the British pound (partly due to inflow of foreign capital attracted by the high interest rates but also due to the large increase in the North Sea oil export), led to the destruction of a huge chunk of the British manufacturing industry, which was already suffering from declining competitiveness.</p>
<p>The Thatcher government&rsquo;s policies were outdone in many respects by the Reagan government that came to power in the US in 1981. The Regan government&rsquo;s policy was called &lsquo;supply side economics&rsquo;. It was argued that the higher income tax rates need to be cut so that the rich need to be given more incentive to invest and create wealth. At the same time, reduction in subsidies to the poor (especially in housing) and the freezing of minimum wages were introduced so that the poor would work harder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the macroeconomic front, as in the UK, interest rates were jacked up in an attempt to reduce inflation. This, predictably, generate a recession and higher unemployment. The resulting rise in borrowing costs and the appreciation of US dollar (thanks to foreign capital inflow in search of high interest rates) resulted in the destruction of a significant portion of the US manufacturing industry, although not as seriously as in the UK. The resulting unemployment further weakened the power of labour, which was already much weaker than in other ACCs, shifting the balance of power in the country decisively in favour of the capitalists.</p>
<p>The most lasting legacy of the high interest rate policy in the US during this period (which is sometimes called the Volcker Shock, following the name of the then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the US central bank) was, however, not in the US. The rise in interest rate resulted in a widespread default on foreign debts by developing nations, which had borrowed heavily in the 1970s. Starting with the default of Mexico in 1982, a large number of developing countries in Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia had difficulties in servicing their loans and had to get money from the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
<p>The IMF and the World Bank launched the so-called Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), which demanded radical changes in policies by the countries getting their financial injection. Trade liberalisation, privatisation of state-owned enterprises, de-regulation of domestic market, budget cuts, high interest rates were demanded. Some countries resisted but by the beginning of the second half of the 1980s, most countries capitulated and launched so-called neo-liberal reforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1989, a decisive turning point came. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and its subsequent dismemberment, the socialist bloc disappeared in a span of 2-3 years. The problems with the centrally-planned economies had been already well known, but few, including the most anti-socialist commentators, thought the bloc implode. With China gradually but surely opening up and liberalising and with Vietnam (unified under the Communist rule in the 1970s) adopting its &lsquo;open door&rsquo; policy (Doi Moi) in 1986, the socialist bloc was reduced to a few die-hard states, like North Korea and Cuba.</p>
