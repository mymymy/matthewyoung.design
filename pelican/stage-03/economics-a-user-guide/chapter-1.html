<h3 class="first">From Pin to PIN</h3>
<p>What is the first ever thing written about in economics? Gold? Land? Banking? Or international trade?</p>
<p>The answer is the pin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, not the PIN that you use for your credit cards. But that little metal thing that most of you do <em>not</em> use &ndash; that is, unless you have long hair and like to keep it tidy.</p>
<p>The making of the pin is the subject of the very first chapter of what is commonly (albeit wrongly) considered to be the first economics book, namely, <em>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</em>, by Adam Smith (1723-1790).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smith starts his book by arguing that the ultimate source of increase in wealth lies in the increase in productivity due to greater division of labour, that is, breaking-up of production processes into smaller, more specialised bits. He argued that this increases productivity in three ways. First, by repeating the same one or two tasks far more often than when they have to perform dozens of tasks, workers become good at what they do more quickly (&lsquo;practice makes perfect&rsquo;). Second, by specialising, workers do not have to spend time moving &ndash; physically and mentally &ndash; between different tasks (reduction in &lsquo;transition costs&rsquo;). Last, but not least, a finer breakdown of the process makes each step easier to be mechanise and thus be performed at super-human speed (&lsquo;mechanisation&rsquo;).</p>
<p>And to illustrate this point, Smith discusses how ten people dividing up the production process of making a pin and specialising in one or two of the sub-processes can produce 48,000 pins (that is, 4,800 pins per person) a day. Compare this to the at most 20 pins each of them can produce a day, Smith pointed out, if each individual worker performed the whole process alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smith called the pin manufacture a &lsquo;trifling&rsquo; example and later went on to note how more complicated the divisions of labour involved are for other products, but there is no denying that he lived in a time when ten people working together to make a pin was still considered a cool thing &ndash; well, at least cool enough to front someone&rsquo;s would-be magnum opus in a cutting-edge subject.</p>
<p>The next two and half centuries saw dramatic developments in technology, driven by mechanisation and the use of chemical processes, not least in the pin industry. Two generations after Smith, the output per worker had nearly doubled. Following Smith&rsquo;s example, Charles Babbage, the 19<sup>th</sup> century mathematician who is known as the conceptual father of the computer (then called the &lsquo;difference engine&rsquo;, which gave the title of one of the classic &lsquo;steam punk&rsquo; sci-fi novels by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling), studied pin factories in 1832. He found that they were producing about 8,000 pins per worker a day. 150 more years of technological progress increased productivity by yet another 100 times, to 800,000 pins per worker per day, according to the 1980 study by Clifford Pratten, a Cambridge economist.</p>
<p>And think of all the new technologies that have come about since Adam Smith&rsquo;s day. Most of them would have been considered the works of magicians (and at that really powerful ones like Dumbledore or Voldemort) to his contemporaries. As As Arthur C. Clarke, the famous sci-fi novelist, once said, &ldquo;[a]ny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not just production technologies &ndash; or how things are made &ndash; that have changed between Adam Smith&rsquo;s time and ours. Economic institutions &ndash; or how production and other economic activities are organised &ndash; have also gone through fundamental transformations since Smith&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The British economy in Smith&rsquo;s time, which he called the &lsquo;commercial society&rsquo;, shared some fundamental similarities to those we find in most of today&rsquo;s economies &ndash; otherwise his work would have been irrelevant. Unlike most other economies of the time (the other exceptions being the Netherlands, Belgium, and parts of Italy), it was already &lsquo;capitalist&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What is the capitalist economy, or capitalism? It is an economy in which production is organised in pursuit of <em>profit</em>, rather than for personal consumption (as in subsistence farming) or for political obligations (as in feudal societies or in centrally-planned economies). It is organised by <em>capitalists</em>, namely, those who own the &lsquo;means of production&rsquo; &ndash; or durable inputs into the production process (say, machines, but not, say, raw materials). They own these either directly or, more commonly these days, indirectly by owning shares in a company that own those means of production. Capitalists hire other people on commercial basis &ndash; <em>wage labourers</em> &ndash; to operate these means of production. Capitalists make profits by producing things for other people, rather than for their personal use, and selling them <em>through the market</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the similarities between Smith&rsquo;s capitalism and today&rsquo;s capitalism do not stretch much beyond those basic characteristics. There are huge differences between the two eras in terms of how these basic characteristics &ndash; private ownership of means of production, profit-seeking, wage employment, and market exchange &ndash; are actually translated into realities.</p>

<div id="section-break"></div>

<p>First of all, who the capitalists are and how they behave are very different between the two eras.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Adam Smith&rsquo;s day, capitalists were real people, usually personally involved in the management of the production process. Most factories (and farms) were owned and run by single individuals or by &lsquo;partnerships&rsquo; made up of a small number of individuals who knew and understood each other. This was a time when many capitalists were physically on the factory floor, ordering their workers about, swearing at them, and even beating them up.</p>
<p>Today, most factories are owned and operated by &lsquo;unnatural&rsquo; persons, namely, corporations. These corporations are &lsquo;persons&rsquo; only in the legal sense. They are in turn owned by a multitude of individuals, who buy shares (or stocks) in them and part-own them. But being a shareholder does not make you a &lsquo;capitalist&rsquo; in the classical sense. You may own 300 of Volkswagen&rsquo;s 300 million shares, but that does not entitle you to fly to its factory in, say, Wolfsburg, Germany and order &lsquo;your&rsquo; workers about in &lsquo;your&rsquo; factory for one-millionth of their working time. It is a completely different world in which ownership and control of the production process are largely separated in most of the largest enterprises.</p>
<p>Unlike in Adam Smith&rsquo;s days, today&rsquo;s owners (namely, shareholders) in most large corporations have only &lsquo;limited liabilities&rsquo;. If something goes wrong with their companies, they lose the money invested in their shares and that is that. In Adam Smith&rsquo;s time, company owners had &lsquo;unlimited liabilities&rsquo;, which meant that when things go wrong, they had to sell their own personal assets to pay back the debts and deal with other consequences of their troubles. There were a few companies around with limited liabilities, such as the East India Company, but you needed a royal charter for that status. Smith himself was actually against the principle of limited liability, believing that those who manage limited liability companies without owning it are in the end playing with &ldquo;other people&rsquo;s money&rdquo; (his phrase) and therefore won&rsquo;t be as vigilant in their management as those who have to risk everything they have.</p>
<p>Companies are organised very differently from Smith&rsquo;s days too, whatever their ownership forms are. In Smith&rsquo;s day, most companies were small, with a simple command structure (at most a caretaker, that is the hired manager, who will have a few foremen and ordinary workers), and usually had only one site of production. Today, many companies are huge, often employing tens of thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of them, or even millions of them (Walmart employs 2.1 million people, while McDonald&rsquo;s, including franchises, employs around 1.8 million people) all over the world. They also have very complicated internal structures, variously made up of divisions, profit centres, semi-autonomous units, and what not, hiring people with complicated job specifications and pay grades with in a complex, bureaucratic command structure.</p>

<div id="section-break"></div>

<p>Second, those who work for other people are also different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Smith&rsquo;s time, most people did not work for capitalists as wage labourers, perhaps except in Britain and the Netherlands. In these two economies, in which industrialisation had progressed considerably, only around 40% of the labour force worked in agriculture, where non-capitalist relationship dominated. Most employment in the agricultural sector was not &lsquo;capitalist&rsquo; in the sense that those who worked the lands were either tenants of aristocratic landlords or small subsistence farmers, rather than wage labourers for agricultural capitalists (Britain was an exception in this regard in that it had quite a lot of capitalist operations in agriculture). In other Western European countries, 50-65% of the labour force still worked in the agricultural sector, where. In the more backward Northern European economies, the proportion was even higher (in Sweden, over 70% of the workforce was still in agriculture in 1870; in Norway around 50% were until 1890).&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this era, even many of those who worked for capitalists were not wage labourers because there were still slaves around. Most of these slaves at Smith&rsquo;s time were not the slaves in the feudal sense &ndash; war prisoners, those who could not pay off their debts, people who were born into certain &lsquo;un-free&rsquo; castes &ndash; but they were certainly not wage labourers. They were &lsquo;means of production&rsquo; used by capitalists, just like tractors or traction animals &ndash; the plantation owners in the American South, the Caribbean, Brazil, and other countries. It was two generations after the publication of <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (henceforth the <em>WON</em>) that slavery was abolished in Britain (1833). It was nearly a century later after the <em>WON </em>and after a bloody civil war that slavery was abolish in the US (1862). Brazil abolished it only in 1888.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While a large proportion of people who worked for capitalists were not wage labourers, many of the wage labourers were people who won&rsquo;t be allowed to become wage labourers today. That is, they were children. Few thought that there is anything wrong with hiring children. Some even praised the practice. Daniel Defoe, in his 1724 book, <em>A Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain</em>, was delighted that in Norwich employment was so plentiful (thanks to the 1721 ban on the import of calicoes, then famous Indian cotton textile) that &ldquo;the very children after 4 or 5 years of age could everyone earn their own bread&rdquo;. <strong>(vol. 1, pp. 62-3; check source)</strong> Child labour subsequently became a major social issue and prompted regulative legislation (initially very ineffective), but that was only after Adam Smith&rsquo;s death in 1790.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, in Britain and other rich countries (although it is another story for developing countries), children (under the age of 15-16) are not allowed to work, except for very limited hours for a limited range of things, like paper rounds. There are no legal slaves, although there are some virtual slaves in the form of trafficked illegal immigrants. Most of the adult workforce, except for around 10% of the workforce that work for themselves (that is, the self-employed), are wage labourers, most of them working for capitalists (some work for the government, cooperatives, or other not-for-profit entities). Most of those who work for capitalists (60-80%) work for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), usually defined as enterprises employing less than 250 people in the European Union and less than 500 in the US. The picture is of course very different in the poor countries in which capitalism is still not very developed. In those countries, 30-90% may not be working for any capitalist, as they are self-employed, the majority of them being engaged in subsistence farming.</p>

<div id="section-break"></div>

<p>Third, markets are also different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Smith&rsquo;s time, markets were largely local or at most national in scope, except in key commodities that were traded internationally &ndash; grains, sugar, slaves, or spices &ndash; or a limited range of manufactured goods &ndash; mainly textile products, like silk, cotton, and woollen goods. These markets were served by numerous small-scale firms, resulting in the state of what economists these days call &lsquo;perfect competition&rsquo;. For people from Smith&rsquo;s time, it would have been impossible even to imagine that companies may be hiring over twice the then size of London population (in 1800, at around 0.8 million) &ndash; Walmart employs 2 million people &ndash; or that they operate in territories that outnumber the then British colonial territories (around 20 at the time) by a factor of sixe &ndash; McDonald&rsquo;s operates in over 120 countries.</p>
<p>Today, most markets are populated, and often manipulated, by large companies. Some of them are the only supplier in the market (monopoly) or, more typically, one of the few suppliers (oligopoly). Their market power may also come from their position as buyers (monopsony or oligopsony) &ndash; Walmart, Sainsbury&rsquo;s, and other large retail chains can get huge discounts from their suppliers because they buy in such large quantity.</p>
<p>Unlike the small companies in Adam Smith&rsquo;s world, monopolistic or oligopolistic firms can actually influence the market outcomes &ndash; in other words, they have what economists call &lsquo;market power&rsquo;. So, a monopolistic firm may deliberately restrict its output to raise its prices to the point that its profit is maximised (I will talk about the technical points later in the book, so you can ignore them now), whereas small companies who have hundreds of competitors cannot influence the market price, even if it manipulates its output level. Oligopolistic firms cannot manipulate their markets as much as a monopolistic firm can, but they may deliberately collude to maximise their profits by not under-cutting each others&rsquo; prices. As a result, these days most countries have a competition law (sometimes called an anti-trust law) in order to counter such &lsquo;anti-competitive&rsquo; behaviours &ndash; breaking up monopolies (for example, the US government broke up AT&amp;T, the telephone company, in 1974) and banning collusion among oligopolies.</p>
<p>Increasingly, many companies are monopolists or oligopolists in international, as well as national, markets. The most extreme example is the civilian aircraft market, which is basically divided up by three companies &ndash; the American Boeing, Europe&rsquo;s Airbus, and Brazil&rsquo;s Embraer. The existence of these global oligopolies even affect the contents of international trade. For example, it is estimated that at least one-third and probably up to half of &lsquo;international&rsquo; trade is actually &lsquo;intra-company&rsquo; trade &ndash; a Toyota subsidiary &lsquo;exporting&rsquo; its products to its parent company in Japan at a price fixed by the latter, rather than by price competition in the market in the classical sense.</p>
<p>Most monopolistic and oligopolistic firms even manipulate consumer tastes, not just prices or quantities. They usually have recognisable brand names, which they cultivate by investing in advertising campaigns, celebrity endorsements, product placements in movies, or sponsorship (and logos on the uniforms) of sports teams. Many countries have restrictions on some of these types of manipulation (e.g., regulation on misleading advertisements, ban on advertising targeted at children), but their effectiveness is limited, as it is difficult to decide where information ends and manipulation starts.</p>

<div id="section-break"></div>

<p>Money &ndash; or more broadly the financial system &ndash; is also very different.</p>
<p>Today, we take it for granted that countries have only one bank that issues its currency &ndash; that is, the central bank. In Europe in Adam Smith&rsquo;s day, most banks, and even some big merchants, issued their own money (notes). Moreover, the bank notes were not notes (or bills, if you are in the US) in the modern sense. Each note was issued to particular persons, had different values, and signed by the cashier issuing it. It was only less than a couple of decades before the <em>WON</em> &ndash; 1759, to be more precise &ndash; that the Bank of England started issuing fixed denomination notes (&pound;10 note in this case &ndash; the &pound;5 note came only in 1793, three years after Adam Smith died). The Bank of England became a true central bank with note issue monopoly only in 1844 (and that was the world&rsquo;s first central bank). And it wasn&rsquo;t two generations after Smith (in 1853) that fully printed note, with no name of the payee and no signature by issuing cashiers, were issued. But even these fixed denomination notes were not notes in modern sense, as their values were explicitly linked to gold, silver, or other precious metals that the issuing bank possesses (known as the Gold &ndash; or Silver or other &ndash; Standard).</p>
<p>Use of banknotes is one thing, but saving with and borrowing from banks &ndash; that is, &lsquo;banking&rsquo;, is another. This was even less developed. Only a small minority had access to banking. In France, it was reported that three-quarters of the population did not have access to banks in 1863 &ndash; nearly a century after the <em>WON</em>. Even in Britain, which had a banking industry that was far more developed than that of France, banking was highly fragmented, with the interest rates different in different parts of the country well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stock markets existed, but given the small number of companies that issued shares (see above), it was still a sideshow in Smith&rsquo;s time. With the memories of the disaster emanating from Britain&rsquo;s South Sea Bubble and France&rsquo;s Mississippi Bubble in 1721 fresh in collective memory, stock markets were seen as gambling dens (some may say it still is). Stock market regulation was minimal and hardly enforced, with the stockbrokers not being even obliged to reveal much information about the companies whose shares they are selling. Other financial markets were even more primitive. The market for government bonds (the very market that is at the centre of the Euro crisis that has shaken the world since 2009) existed only in a few countries, such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands. Corporate bond markets (that is, markets dealing in bonds issued by companies) was not really developed even in Britain.</p>
<p>Today, we have highly developed financial markets &ndash; not just the banking sector and the stock market but also the government bond market, the corporate bond market, and increasingly the markets for the alphabet soup of financial derivatives (ABS, MBS, CDO, CDO<sup>2</sup>, CDS &ndash; you name it). The system is ultimately backed by the central bank that acts as the &lsquo;lender of last resort&rsquo; and lend without limits during financial crises &ndash; its absence in Smith&rsquo;s time and made the management of financial panic very difficult (as we are also see in the recent crisis in the Eurozone, whose supposed central bank &ndash; the European Central Bank &ndash; does not really act as one).</p>
<p>Unlike in Smith&rsquo;s time, there are a lot of regulations on what actors in the financial market can do &ndash; how much of their deposits banks have to keep in reserve when they lend (around 8-10%), what kind of information about themselves companies selling shares need to reveal, what kinds of assets different financial institutions are allowed to hold (e.g., pension funds are not allowed to hold risky assets). Despite this, the increasing number of and complexity of the financial markets have made it difficult to control them even with these regulations &ndash; as we have learnt from the outbreak of the 2008 global financial crisis, which is still dogging the world.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="section-break"></div>

<p>Capitalism has gone through enormous changes in the two and half centuries that divide us from Adam Smith. This means that, while some of the basic principles that Smith talked about still remain valid, that is the case only at very general levels. So, for example, while it may be true that competition is what keeps producers efficient, the very way in which competition is fought is very different between Adam Smith&rsquo;s market of small, geographically-confined companies and those giant transnational corporations of our time. In an economy that has a central bank and in which money is not explicitly linked to gold reserve, what the government can (and should) do to manage the economy are fundamentally different from what the government in an economy without such conditions can do.</p>
<p>However beautiful and timeless his analogy of the &lsquo;invisible hand&rsquo; may seem (although that analogy was actually not a central one in the <em>WON</em> &ndash; he used it only once in the book and to talk about a relatively obscure topic <strong>cite?</strong>), we must understand that the economy that Smith was talking about was fundamentally different from ours. The point is that, however great an economic theory may be, they are specific to their times and spaces, so, their fruitful applications require a good knowledge of the technological and institutional forces that characterise the particular markets, industries, countries that we are trying to analyse with the help of those theories.</p>
<p>This is why we need to know how capitalism has evolved, if we are to understand different economic theories in their right contexts. This is the task we turn to in the next chapter.</p>
